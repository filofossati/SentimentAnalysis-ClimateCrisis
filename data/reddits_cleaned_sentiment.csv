* firstly, i'll be using usps.
* i want to incorporate recycled (by me) paper whenever possible since i save my paper products to recycle/upcycle. stuff like if i ever need packing-stuffing i can use shredded paper, and making my own handmade cardstock and paper for stuff like envelopes, etc.  i'll have a cricut so i'm thinking i should be able to use that to cut homemade recycled paper into whatever shapes i need. which brings me to:
* if i make my own envelopes, how do i make sure they're fully recyclable/compostable with the glue i use (side question: is paper actually compostable, or just recyclable?) -- basically, what's a good glue, either homemade or store-bought, that won't ruin the whole thing?
* on a similar note -- if i need to ship things in a cardboard box in the future (that would be okay, right? does any cardboard box work, or should i be looking specifically for ones that are advertised as compostable or recyclable?), i think it would be cute to have a little ""please compost/recycle me!"" stamp (or sticker). what would be the best way to do that? i'm assuming not all inks are compostable/recyclable (sorry for saying those so many times, i'm just unsure on which one it'll end up being), right? so should i look for a vegan ink pad and use a custom stamp? is printer ink recyclable? then i would be able to make my own (non-vinyl) sticker for it. let me know what you guys think is best, but my gut instinct is telling me a simple rubber stamp and a vegan ink pad would be best. 
* i saw someone mention paper tape. i did a brief google search and saw a bunch of different options. is all paper tape recyclable or compostable, or again should i be looking for something specific?
* for any of you that have your own etsy shop, what are some of *your* sustainable go-to's?

that's all i have at the moment, but please let me know if i've missed something! thank you all in advance, you're awesome :)",0.9969

well…
-the building of a sustainable infrastructure and maintenance would create thousands of jobs.

1,"sustainable energy what is energy sustainability?☝💭❓

* although we are not at full sustainability, it is possible with correct measures taken this includes:
   * not using fossil fuels❌
   * not being greedy with the energy❌
   * relying on renewables❌

here’s how you're using energy!!😱😦

* being inefficient with energy actually adds up (multiple tons of co2 a year; i even calculated mine to be 20 co2 tons/year **wow**)
* everyday electronics slowly suck power through the outlets
* leaving lights turned on when you leave a room
* turning heat up in the winter or turning ac down in the summer helps reduce usage

what does energy sustainability mean for the planet and what are the sdgs??🌎

* cost from climate change about public health and safety 
* sdgs are sustainable development goals that aim for a better future
* sdgs are developed by the united nations
* clean energy might be nice, but it’s not cheap
* responsible consumption and production is key
* cleaner energy means climate action

how you should get involved and contribute to sustainable energy!😀🌱

* support green energy initiatives✅
   * solar farms
   * wind turbine farms
   * nuclear energy 
   * geothermal heating 
   * hydro power
* vote people into office with green platforms✅

i’m personally very frustrated with the pace at which we’re transitioning to a sustainable society. i honestly want it to happen as quickly as possible rather than letting the status quo dictate when we reach this end goal… if at all. 

i think if we put our minds together to analyze the big picture situation during our discussions and add in some informed input, we might see opportunities to create something that makes a difference.

if you’re not particularly creative… maybe you’re an expert in the field and you would like to add to the discussion, you can reach out as well. creating rich discussions regarding what can be done to bring about sustainability is the point, i’m sure anyone with ideas can add value to our conversations, even if you simply want to support the effort in any other way. you can reach out, i’ll link us together in some way. we can start talking, strategizing, and creating.",0.9874

i am a huge sustainability fan and think about how we can have an impact on a daily basis.  
what always made me wonder was the fact that we say ""vote with your money"", in other words we should support companies that do good and try to avoid companies that do bad. but why is it so difficult to find these companies that do good? the companies that pay the extra money for a better planet, that go the extra mile?

i made a tool that collects these sustainable products and companies: [http://sustainablealternativeto.com/](http://sustainablealternativeto.com/)

instead of trying to come up with a sustainability score or trying to get companies on a directory etc, i thought of a much simpler solution to create a database that lists sustainable brands and products. there are many great labels out there, that do exceptional work to verify aspects of a companies' sustainability. we simply collect them in a huge database and let you filter by each sustainability aspect such as climate neutral, socially responsible (b corp certified), vegan, plastic free, circular, or multi use.

one thing is clear. the products and companies that fall under these labels are better then the ones who don't. it's as simple as that. are they perfect. no. should we still support them? absolutely. we carefully select only the labels that stood our due diligence, because not all labels are great.

truth be told, this website is a proof pf concept. technically absolutely feasible. it's made with airtable and softr and could easily connect to apis and other services.  
if you think you would benefit from such a directly, please consider subscribing to our waitlist. if we reach 100+ people i will find the resources to make this a reality!

1,"is the us going in the wrong direction on plastic packaging? if so, why? i don't know how it is elsewhere, but it seems like plastic packaging is increasing in the us. certain products that used less plastic, such as powdered laundry detergent (packaged in cardboard boxes) or concentrated shampoo (which used a smaller plastic squeeze-tube instead of a larger plastic bottle) have mostly disappeared. other products, such as milk, eggs, and orange juice, increasingly use plastic or styrofoam instead of paper-based packaging. the more expensive products aimed at affluent eco-conscious consumers may still use paper-based packaging, but the most economical products generally use plastic or styrofoam.

caveat: the above is just personal observation; i don't have stats. but if my observations are accurate, next question is, why? i guess the easy answer is that plastic packaging is cheaper, and consumer preferences explain why some products have disappeared. but i'm not sure about that. us consumers are cost-conscious, and while that would explain why many would buy eggs in styrofoam if they're cheaper than eggs in cardboard, by the same token many would still buy powdered detergent, which was cheaper than liquid. so why are detergent manufacturers pushing liquids and pods? i gather that powdered detergent is still widely used outside the us.

i've heard that the petroleum industry is pushing plastic packaging to make up for reduced use of oil for energy (current and projected). it makes sense that plastic packaging might have been more expensive in the 70s and 80s when there was greater demand for oil as fuel and less domestic supply. i wonder if there is anything else going on that would lead manufacturers of consumer products to use more plastic packaging.",0.8256

1,"looking for ideas on how to make new home more sustainable! uk based hello everyone!

i was wondering if i could pick some brains as to what i can do to make my new home as healthy/sustainable as possible. this to me includes keeping energy and water usage down, repairable / reusable products, healthy (both physically and mentally) inside (plants/plant wall, that type of thing) and good lighting that is energy efficient and also good for us inhabitants.

for info, this house is a new-build in the uk, and we will move in around april time. some items i have no choice in, such as the white goods they use for the kitchen (we reserved the house post-decision/ordering time). it should be well insulated but also ventilated so no issues with damp or mould. if i had my way, i’d build a house with everything i want already built in, including a ground source heat pump!

so far, i have a few things on my list that i can do:

- dualit toaster and kettle - these are very high quality, efficient and made in the uk, and are built to be easy to repair and replace components
 lifespan of 20+ years.
- thermostatic radiator valves - control the heat on a room by room basis rather than heating the whole house on the thermostat. 
- may look into energy suppliers that use renewable sources (more tricky at the moment since so many are going bust with our energy crisis atm)
- using smol cleaning products for general cleaning, as well as washing tablets and fabric conditioner, and dishwasher tabs. note here, i may just stop using fabric conditioner as i’m not sure it’s really necessary!

my list feels kinda short but there’s already lifestyle changes we’ve made too. but can anyone add anything else that’s a potentially easy win?

1,"maybe we shouldn’t live sustainably 



let me be clear, i genuinely thought we should stop climate change at first. i am not a troll, or some kind of weirdo. i’m also a vegan activist.
before you start reading: be aware that our desire to live is also biological, not entirely objective. once you realize that, you can be open minded to the idea that non existence is not that bad.
here is why i think one shouldn’t be a climate activist, and shouldn’t make an effort to live a green lifestyle. but the only effort one should make if he wants to do good, is to be anti climate activist. in order to help climate change do it’s thing). i suppose i have had this thought for at least one year, in the darkest deepest part of my mind: the world is full with endless suffering. therefore, it would be better if life didn’t exist on earth at all.
now two things:
• we couldn’t destroy all life on earth even if we tried. we got animals here that can even survive in the outer space for a few years, so that’s off the table.
• if humans weren’t on earth, it would be undoubtedly the best thing that could ever happen. and that’s part of the reason why i want climate change to take over the world(to fully or almost fully extinct all humans). a new better world will be born from the ashes of the climate apocalypse. a world free from humans(that create the most suffering on earth, so much that we can’t even imagine). and the apocalypse might even be worth the suffering it will cause to humans and animals.
i know that animals will die and suffer horribly, and that they will be affected first. but remember, the apocalypse will be an extremely short era in earth’s history, which means that it’s close range consequences will be nothing compared to its long range consequences, which will be good.
most of the avoidable unnecessary victims of now are victims of humans. and yes, the victims of the climate apocalypse will be victims as well. however they will be gone for a good reason for a change.
and it doesn’t really matter who will have to be extinct or be affected first, by the apocalypse. please notice that i have the perfect reason not to have value of life anymore. the life in the wild must be too bad to consider them as good, therfore it’s not a big loss if a lot of animals die. i’d consider to extinct all life from earth if i could. animals in the wild suffer from hunger, injuries, weather. one day i saw that poor cat i saw outside, and then realized that there are a lot cats like him. they absolutely must extremely suffer from the rain and cold. most of us western humans dont know and don’t have to experience even 10% of this pain, because we are so far from this survival situation, thanks to unbelievably accessible and high technology. now think about all the insects, and ants. every drop of rain can cause them the most long and painful death. they must be terrified. and this is only a very little example. this is why i don’t think it a loss of animal life on earth will be reduced due to the climate(life is not that good, even bad).
by the way, believe me, i am well aware of horrible consequences of not stopping climate change, to both humans and non humans. and it does make sad not less that it makes you. but i think i really have the perfect reason to be sure that it will be worth it, for the greater good.
there is a high possibility that it will prevent more suffering than it will create. keep in mind, if we killed humans in the pace we kill animals, it would take maybe. a week until we were all dead. earth now is already a huge intensive consistent factory of suffering, because of humans. we could  cancel  most of this factory for at least 100000 years. all it takes is just few especially intense decades of suffering, and that’s it. i know the cost is exteremly painful, but overall it worths it great deal

1,"how to quantify the environment impact of a property development? hi guys. i had been reading up on various topics pertaining climate change for the past one year and since i am working in the construction industry, i would very much like to know if there is any way to quantify the environmental impact of a property development, say in terms of the number of flora and fauna being displaced due to mining, deforestation, etc just based on say, the number of floors of the building being constructed.

the main reason i am asking is that i would like to compile this information and make it public, for more awareness.

i might not have articulated my thoughts very well but it would be much appreciated if anyone could point me to the right direction. thanks!!!",0.9319
1,"any ideas how i can get this message out? hello  out there... my name is marty, i'm a sustainable life practitioner and  advocate living in pittsburgh, pa, and my current trash out put is roughly one regular kitchen bag every 2 to 2.5 years. as well ad many other reduction and sustainable practices.

now, i'm developing a 'big idea' bulk food store in my area, but it's taking  longer than i thought (but not shocking) to collect the rest of my  funding...as it's a lot. so, in the mean time, and to try and spur  another smaller sustainable project along, i'm gifting away a small  portion of my funding to lift another project up. as it could take a  while for nlb to get going, and i don't want to sit idle if another  project can get up and running sooner!

this amount won't effect me getting the total funding that i need, as that is way bigger.

my  question to anyone out there: how can i get my gift away message out  there? so far it's been a total shut down as i've been getting flagged, blocked, and marked as spam.

any thoughts?

thanks!

1,"some articles i needed to write for my service & action delaying climate mitigation action and allowing for transitory temperature overshoots necessitate large-scale carbon dioxide removal (cdr) in the second half of this century, which may have negative consequences for land, food, and ecosystems. meanwhile, attaining climate targets without global net-negative emissions necessitates early and quick emission reduction actions, which poses immediate problems. we examine the implications of scenarios that do not rely on land-based cdr technology for land-use and food systems. early climate action provides various benefits and trade-offs, and it prevents the need for substantial (mitigation-induced) changes in land use in the long run. long-term benefits include cheaper food prices, a lower risk of starvation, and less demand for irrigation water. simultaneously, near-term mitigating pressures in the agriculture, forest, and land-use sectors, as well as the required land area for energy crops, increase, leading to an increased danger of food shortages.

following the kyoto protocol, the european union committed to reducing its greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions by 20% below 1990 levels by 2020. carbon dioxide is the most significant ghg. to satisfy this commitment, governments must address the sustainability problem of offsetting expanding population and wealth by dematerializing less energy per gdp and decarbonizing less carbon per energy. i examined carbon dioxide emissions from 1993 to 2004 to see if meeting the challenge was feasible. although emissions in the union as a whole increased by only 0.31 percent per year on average, emissions and their drivers differed significantly between the 27 member states. there was some dematerialization and decarbonization, but not enough to counteract the minor population growth and fast expanding prosperity. to complete its debt within the next 12 years, the eu27 would have to dematerialize and decarbonize 1.9–2.6 times faster than it did from 1993 to 2004 to offset its growing population and wealth. as a result, completing its duty only by reducing fossil carbon emissions is quite doubtful.",0.8382

main idea was this: you will need much less water to flush and effectively move solid waste if the water is extracted from it first. 

so my idea is, toilets that have some type of water removal (a shitpress?) as a first step. 

other ideas:

* require use of greywater for flushing
* two waste systems, starting at the toilet: one for urine, another for solid waste
* use a little extra energy at the flush so that less water is required to move waste to press tank
* possibly even sanitize and reuse some of the initial flush water.

unrelated to waste ideas:

to truly resolve the packaging issue, need completely new distribution systems that have entirely reusable/recyclable packaging. can take advantage of robot delivery and pickup. example: food delivery. need something like, sterilized plastic tupperware or something mandated rather than throw-away containers. can use robots to deliver to new type of service that cleans them and returns them to the restaurant.",-0.5668

1,"seitan every day. is it bad for you? i love seitan. it is a very cheap and quick dose of proteins which can be easily cometed by lentils and other legumes. 

my question is: is eating every day seitan unhealthy?

we should keep in mind 4 points:

1) seitan is a highly processed food since it is basically ""condensed gluten"" from wheat.

2) when you eat s. you take a lot of gluten. of course people usually eat additional sources of gluten like pasta, cereals and bread. of course you can increase rice (or other gluten free products) reducing other gluten based foods. i don't think i am wrong but 50 g of seitan contain more gluten than 350 g of pasta/bread.
moreover many people claim that the quality of gluten has been decreasing since they introduced genetically modified grains (they should be called cultivar). unfortunately i am not an expert in this field.

3) when i say eating s. evey day i mean 50 g of seitan per day and i am talking about a pure seitan steak. many seitan products contain more than 40% of soy.

4) please dont say ""eating every day seitan is better than meat"" since we are discussing seitan per se.

1,"cult food science establishes global cellular agriculture advisory board there are two kinds of agricultural products derived from cell culture: acellular products and cellular products. acellular products are made of organic molecules like proteins and fats and contain no cellular or living material in the final product. cellular products are made of living or once-living cells. products harvested from cell culture are exactly the same as those harvested from an animal; the only difference is how they are made.

&#x200b;

acellular animal-sourced foods (like milk) can be made without animals by using a microbe like yeast or bacteria. in the example of milk made with yeast, the yeast are altered by inserting into them the gene carrying the blueprints for casein, a milk protein. since all cells read the same genetic code, the yeast, now carrying so-called recombinant dna, makes casein identical to the casein cows make in their milk. most cellular products exist in tissues. in cellular agriculture, tissues are made outside the body in a process called tissue engineering. cells from a particular species and tissue type are assembled on a scaffold (to grow on) with serum (food for the cells to feed on while they grow) in an environment that promotes growth.

&#x200b;

today, tissue engineering is a relatively new scientific pursuit, with a focus on clinical applications such as growing skin for burn victims or organs for patients requiring organ transplantation. the focus is on the tissue having a biological function — in other words, the tissue-engineered organ needs to be able to work in a living person. while the science behind growing tissue for an organ transplant is similar to growing muscle tissue for food, both come with a set of very different considerations. for example, tissues for meat or leather do not need to work as an organ in someone’s body. instead, meat needs to have a particular nutritional value, mouthfeel, or taste. leather needs to have a certain strength, texture, or softness. all cellular agriculture products need to be made affordably — that means producing tissues at a scale much larger than what is required for patients requiring organ transplants.

&#x200b;

compared to their conventional counterparts, cellular agriculture products have fewer environmental impacts, a safer, purer product, and a more consistent supply. this is because the product is being produced in safe, sterile, controlled conditions. cellular agriculture has the ability to design and tune what you are making. for instance, you could make meat with fewer saturated fats and more unsaturated fats, or you could make leather of different thicknesses. you could make milk without lactose, or eggs without cholesterol. despite the benefits and opportunities presented by cellular agriculture, it remains an underfunded area of research.

&#x200b;

cult food science investment platform for cellular agriculture does not only acknowledge this, but is trying to actively change it. the company has just established a global cellular agriculture advisory board to guide the company’s pursuit of defendable cellular agriculture-focused intellectual property, patents and royalty streams.

&#x200b;

they have assembled such a world class advisory board, all thought leaders in their respective areas of cellular agriculture, cell biology, pharmacology, biotechnology and alternative protein solutions. dr. paul burridge is an esteemed pharmacologist who is currently conducting research around induced pluripotent stem cells (ipsc) for the purpose of advancing cultivated meat. rob harris is a active- start-up advisor focused on bridging the gap between scientific possibility and commercially viable products in the field of cellular agriculture. dr. anjum mullani an alumnus of institut pasteur, paris’ department of developmental and stem cell biology, animal biotechnology, molecular biology and cellular senescence. dr. mullani is focused on applying her diverse knowledge base to accelerate the advancement of cellular agriculture. that's not all, don't fret...cult expects to add other members to the advisory board in due course, as appropriate.

&#x200b;

the global factory farming and aquaculture crises are intensifying in real time, posing a major threat to the world as we know it. cellular agriculture will be the solution and change we need. however we need to do our part by informing ourselves and investing green. companies such as cult food science, have unprecedented exposure to the most innovative start-ups, private or early-stage cultivated meat and cultured dairy companies around the world.

&#x200b;

they have leading revolutionary investees, and as soon as their ipo goes public $cult, they will be changing the game for cellular agriculture. do not take my advice as a financial advisor, i'm just here to spread awareness, and try to change our planet one investment at a time. do your own research and be the change.",0.9882
1,"why i started to make every day earth day in the spring of 2017, my fiancé and i relocated from virginia to the state of ohio in order for him to pursue a career opportunity. the two of us had grown up in virginia and both of our families still reside there to this day, so this move was a large adjustment for us. we had become accustomed to all of the beautiful amenities that virginia had to offer; we had access to mountains with the nearby appalachian trail, the beach with virginia beach and yorktown beach, famous amusement parks such as busch gardens, and so much more. we had no idea what to expect from ohio, except a significant decrease in the average temperature and an increase in snowfall. however, the climate and landscape of virginia was not the only thing that we were longing for after the move.

it only took a few months of living in ohio for us to feel homesick and miss being able to interact with our friends and family members on a daily basis. of course we had the convenience of modern day technology which allowed us to call them, text them, and even facetime them—but virtual interactions are just not the same. one day on facetime with my fiancé’s six-year-old brother, mike, i had an idea about other ways that we could stay in communication. i thought we could take a more old school approach, and asked him, “would you want to be my pen-pal?” i saw his confused face just staring blankly back at me on the screen. initially, i assumed that his camera had frozen, but really he just had no clue what a pen-pal was! after a short explanation of the definition, he eagerly agreed to write to me once a month. of course this would require his mom to assist him in reading my letters, writing his responses, and mailing his letters to me, so we had to get her on board as well. she agreed to help us in the process and i began to draft my first letter to him.

it took me a while to settle on a topic for my first letter to mike. keeping in mind that i have always had a fascination with nature and my go to activities always took place outdoors, i thought it would be a fun idea to create a nature based scavenger hunt. the two of us could complete the scavenger hunt in our respective states, me in ohio and him in virginia, and be able to compare our findings. the scavenger hunt was simple and required us to take a “nature walk” and try to locate various items along the way. the items had to match the requirements and characteristics outlined on the list. for example, one item had to be blue while another had to be rough. i had to be mindful of the attention span of a six-year-old boy, so there were only around eight items for us to find on the walk. i went out to a nearby park that same day and collected all eight items from the list. some of my items included a sleek sheath stone from the rocky river riverbed, a pastel blue chip from a crushed robin’s egg, a black and red speckled bird’s feather, and the star of the show—a four leaf clover. i delicately wrapped my bounty in a few layers of paper towel, slipped it into an envelope with proper postage, put the parcel in the mailbox, and eagerly waited for his reply.

after waiting a week for his letter to arrive, my anticipation had been building. i just could not wait to see what items he had collected and see how similar or different they were from my own. i used my index finger to break the seal on the envelope, being careful not the damage the natural goodies inside. i peeled back the flap of the envelope and peered inside. to my surprise, i did not see the organic materials i had expected to see like twigs and pebbles, but instead i saw a variety of synthetic materials such as a string of blue yarn, a crinkled m&m’s wrapper, a piece of wrinkly newspaper, and a small shiny shard of glass. while he had successfully completed the scavenger hunt and checked off all of the required items, he had only included one natural item in the entirety of his collection: a singular dry brown leaf.

i was absolutely devastated that these were the items that his “nature walk” had resulted in. seeing this collection of items impacted me in a way that i was not expecting it to. i began to think about the environment as a whole and i started to fear that our future generations, such as mike’s generation, might not have access to nature in the same way that i did growing up. i want mike to be able to experience the natural world just as i did, but i fear that human impact and pollution might not allow him to do so. this scavenger hunt situation was a wakeup call for me, and caused me to analyze my own contribution to the poor condition and outlook of our environment. i researched the various agencies responsible for creating laws to protect the environment, the environmental protection agency, as well as the systems we currently have in place to minimize human impact. i did not feel that these were adequate and it got me thinking, what can we do as individuals to make an impact? i believe that we have a responsibility to take care of our environment and ensure that we protect it for our future generations through environmental preservation and conservation. this was when i truly became passionate about protecting the environment.

from then on i made small adjustments to my daily living to help reduce my contribution to environmental pollution. i switched to reusable cotton pads, i purchased a set of reusable portable utensils, and stopped using paper towels and disposable water bottles. i vowed to monitor my usage of electricity and water, making sure to turn off light switches and faucets if i was not actively using them. i also decided to try to car pool or make use of public transportation whenever possible. while these changes may seem small or insignificant in the grand scheme of things, it is important to remember that every little bit helps. i believe that we each have a responsibility to do our part to protect and preserve the environment. if we don’t, what will that mean for mike’s generation or the generation after him? in my next letter to mike, i explained the meaning and importance of environmental preservation and conservation, and included a check-list of all of the day to day changes he could make to help do his part. i took this opportunity to change my own actions and to teach mike about the consequences his own actions can have on the world. i managed to take this unfortunate situation and give it a positive outcome.

i encourage each of you reading this to take the time to analyze your own contributions to our current environmental dilemmas and look for ways to both reduce your negative impacts and increase your positive impacts. this might be in the form of actively volunteering for or donating to environmental renewal projects in your community, while in other cases it might be simply picking up a piece of trash you come across on the beach, turning off the lights/water when not actively using them, sorting your waste for landfill items vs. recyclable items, or carpooling to work to reduce emissions. it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that these small acts will not make an impact on the overall situation, but in reality, these small efforts can and do have a huge impact. living a greener and more environmentally conscious lifestyle could have a ripple effect leading others to follow in your footsteps. we can make a difference and i feel that we have an obligation to try. what part will you play in this issue and what will you do to make a positive change?

**tl;dr** i created a nature based scavenger hunt for me and my young relative to complete. we had to find items that matched certain descriptions like: something blue or something rough. i found natural items such as rocks, leaves, and feathers while he found synthetic items such as yarn, wrappers, and newspaper. this made me fear for his generation and forced me to recognize the need for environmental protection and conservation. i made changes in my own life and encourage readers to do the same. how can we work both individually and collectively to combat this issue?",0.9988

for sustainability reference:  our cotton is in the top 1% of organic cotton, it's grown within 100km of the mill that processes it, turns it into our textiles, and passes it along to our dye house. this allows us to maintain incredibly low co2 emissions through this process. our dye house holds over a dozen environmental and human rights certifications. they also use some of the most advanced technology in the industry that allows for our dying process to use 1/10th of the dye that the process traditionally entails. then we spend 30 days cleaning the water then send it back to the farm for ag usage. we even catch the steam created in the process. six water bottles go into the polyester used in the shirt, the mailer bags are reusable, we even take very careful attention to the co2 used in the shipping process, and ultimately we have a carbon positive process. our goal is to show people this needs to be the standard(bare minimum) all clothing manufacturers are held to. we don't think that message will resonate at a $70 price point.

1,"cult food science (cse: cult) leads seed investment round for celebrity brendan brazier’s fiction foods happy tuesday ladies and gents.  for those that haven’t yet heard the news, cult food science has emerged as the sole strategic investor in fiction food llc’s seed round.  so what's the big deal? fiction foods is another disruptive player entering the foodtech space.  in a nutshell, it leverages emerging technology to help construct a transparent, intelligently designed, nutritionally-superior and smarter food system at a lower environmental cost than what is currently available. built upon a data-driven approach to product construction, fiction foods has the goal of obtaining more nutrients (proteins, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, phytochemicals) while consuming less of each natural resource (land, water, fossil fuel). they call this the nutrient to-resource ratio, and it is their “north star”. 

&#x200b;

the founder of this amazing company is none other than brendan brazier. co-developer of beyond meat’s (bynd) “beast burger”, and co-founder of vega (vega). bynd is currently valued at $5b, and vega was acquired in 2015 by whitewave foods company for us$550 million, representing one of the most successful cash exits in the nascent years of the plant-based industry.  so in other words, mr. brazier has a proven track record of success for getting disruptive alt-food companies off the ground.

&#x200b;

as we’ve seen over the past month, cult food science has been strategically investing in a number of cellular agriculture companies such as melibeo (bee-free honey), which was recently named as one of time magazine's top 100 inventions of the year, and not to forget as well as investing in 3d bio-tech. dovetailing nicely with this larger trend, fiction food’s corporate concept and strategy is a perfect fit with high growth-potential for cult’s expanding portfolio of investee companies in the cellular agriculture space.

&#x200b;

considering brenda brazier's astronomical success with previous (similar) ventures, my assessment is that fiction foods clearly has serious potential to make a name for itself in this burgeoning field. for impact/food-tech investors interested in global food security and alternatives to the factory food/meat industry, cult’s recent strategic investment into fiction foods is precisely the type of bullish indicator one would hope to see before the former’s imminent ipo.  keep an eye out, dyor, and this should not be construed as financial advice.  trade responsibly folks!",0.9941

next year i want to do a road trip round scotland, which will be about 2000 miles in total from my house and back. now obviously driving that distance isn't exactly sustainable, is it something i shouldn't do? or is there a more sustainable way to do it?

(nb: i'll be driving an ice car - i simply cannot afford electric at the moment).

* where should i go for local purchases? common products i tend to purchase are morning stat farms, beyond meat, and gardein. oftentimes, i get these from kroger (i currently live in louisville, ky), although i’d like to know if they can be found in local shops).
* does kroger count as a local business? one thing i do remember from my time working at a kroger myself is that one of the deductions from my paycheck was “union dues,” which led me to believe kroger was part of a worker’s union and/or was a local business (due to being family-owned).
* for those that aren’t vegan (not that i’m that concerned), how do you get non-vegan products in more sustainable ways? do you get them from a local farmer’s market?
* what are some general tips you can give for more sustainable living? i try not to purchase animal products intentionally.
* does this count as a leftist subreddit? part of this sub’s mo is taking a stand against mass environmental damage at the hands of capitalism, leading me to believe it’s a leftist group. on the other hand, what may prevent a right-wing person from participating in discussions on this sub? can they still be part of the sustainability movement?
* how do you try to live sustainably, yet affordably (on a roughly $20k to $50k salary)?
* if i still have meat in a family’s house that no one is eating, yet i never paid for, should i eat it over throwing it away? should i simply give it to some other people, preferably poor/hungry people?

today the focus is on cheap products - in short term. let's get the example of a toaster i saw which was sold in the 1960s. the job it did was the same as a toaster today - zoasting the bread. not better or worse than a toaster today. it was almost completely made of steel and thpugh it was almost impossible to damage it.

look at a toaster today. a lot of plastics, even electronic parts, which get damaged by time due to the heat of a toaster - a very natural thing. these models will only last a few years. so companies produce waste, not new products, and we don't take care of this. because the waste product costs 1$ less....",-0.7234

effectively organizing the left means we need a meta-platform for groups of all sizes, designed for content creators to funnel frustrated people into real local activism work. that work gets coordinated nationally by existing humanitarian groups once those currently disparate organizations have a positive space to collaborate.

2. chemical usage in desalination technologies: environmental impact and possible alternatives

the world is constantly evolving and changing. everyone who lives upon this planet leaves a carbon footprint in this world. we use many of the earth's natural resources to do our daily activities from day to day. we use gas for our cars, stoves and indoor fireplaces. the gas we use for these functions causes chemicals to be released into the air and contributes to air pollution.  we also use water clean water in our houses for cooking, washing our hands, showers and drinking. not everyone in the world is fortunate enough to have clean water to use. electricity is used in houses and buildings, which uses up coal, oil, natural gas and more. this also contributes to light pollution. 

over time the amount of resources being used on a daily basis adds up quickly in a world of over 7 billion people, which also means the pollution continues to get worse. climate change and global warming are also in result of these factors in more. the planet is our home and it's important to think about ways to protect it and how we can effectively use their resources and think of ways in our daily lives to produce less waste and pollution.

however, i recently came across a brand on social media which seemed to have a great cause behind it including them advocating for sustainability. their items were 100% cotton and looked very fashionable. the problem for me: the price of their items was over $250.  

now, it's obviously a personal choice on how much people choose to spend on clothing.  but shouldn't sustainable fashion be affordable as well? if we're so passionate about sustainability, shouldn't we want it accessible for all, not only the rich who are willing or able to spend that much on clothing? it just felt very hypocritical to me. just curious to hear y'all's thoughts on this topic.",0.9448

1,"must the fossil fuel industry end to save the planet? hi guys,

firstly, just wanted to preface this is not my position, i am asking this from the perspective of those who believe otherwise. let me explain:

some people think we can save the planet by going ‘net zero’ meaning instead of actually ending the fossil industry, we instead have machines that suck the carbon out of the air and sell it back to people as fuel. thus, when scaled up, we will end up having net zero i.e. a scenario where fossil fuel can exist so long as the carbon it emits is captured by these machines and we essentially create a ‘sustainable’ loop whereby no extra carbon is emitted.

what are your thoughts?

i have serious doubts about it personally.

thanks in advance.",0.6322

some people will die from the climate changing. but people die every day from lots of things. the problem will be there are too many people, living in places they shouldn't be.

plenty of people live sustainable lives. they are also dirt poor and backwards. think amazonian tribes and africans in mudhuts. they also never changed the world, they are losers.

the climate is changing because we are winning. capitalism means we can go to the mall, get a starbucks, drive home in a suv and watch the bachelor with the air con on full blast on a hot and humid summer day.

the trick to capitalism is that nothing stands still. either you are winning, or you are losing. in going ""green"", the biggest losers are the poor. the rich will push the the great reset agenda of ""own nothing and be happy"". that's rubbish. i want to own lots of things and be happy. plus, i'll be dead in 50 years and so will most people i know.

don't want anyone to suffer after you've gone? stop having children. in the meantime, show your support for the fossil fuel industry, for the capitalist system that has given you the means to post on reddit like you are now. the rich capitalists who don't give a flying f about the planet are your friends, because they continue to ensure your economic relevance and theirs. the enemy is the green communists, not happy until everyone is dragged down to the same level of backwards poverty they need to make their vision work.",-0.7399

""the position we have got ourselves into with the environment is analogous to looking at your bank account and seeing there is still £1,000 in it and spending it all, only to find out later that none of your bills had been paid by the bank and now you have to tighten your belt""

&#x200b;

i prefer this to a credit card analogy as it implies a bit less blame so the listener won't immediately become defensive. i am trying to communicate the fact that essentially the late 20th century was an anomaly, the ""good times"" of every middle class household having multiple vehicles, cheap energy, cheap meat, creating as much waste as you want, was really just due to the fact that those things were priced below the real market value because all the externalities were not included in the price. so people aren't now being punished but they do have to return to a lifestyle where the full cost of their behaviour is accounted for and when you have had things so good for so long and you didn't think you were doing any harm, this feels like a punishment.

any way, one of the last things to do is transfer my savings account over to a sustainably focused bank. i really enjoy the customer service and usability of chase (and have also been a wells fargo customer for years), but i'm sick of keeping my money with an institution that i know is funding investments that are anti-sustainability.

i've done some research, and kind of disappointed in what i've been able to find. if anyone has experience with these banks and can provide feedback (or other suggestions) i'd really appreciate it! i want my savings to work just like i am. i am not concerned about interest rates, transaction maximums, etc. i just want somewhere i can trust (both to use my money sustainably and that i won't be defrauded), has a good ui, and customer service i can speak with.

guys. if there's one thing i know about the climate crisis it's this: it is very serious, someone, somewhere should be doing a lot about it and i am one hundred percent sure that whoever that person is, it isn't me. that's a thought absolutely everyone has! i have it, you probably have it, ceos have it, politicians have it, absolutely everyone has that thought. the problem with these huge systems we all live in is that there is a diffusion of responsibility. one option is that everyone in the world takes responsibility for their little part and another is that everyone in the world plays a game of responsibility hot potato. no prizes for guessing which one humanity chose! ""zara, you should take responsibility and pay a living wage across your supply chain"", we say, throwing the potato to them while picking up a pair of slacks. ""oh, well, we tell our suppliers to behave! they sign a formal agreement!"", says zara, throwing the potato to the suppliers. ""well, if zara paid us enough money we could afford to give people labour rights"" say the suppliers, throwing the potato back to zara. ""well, people don't want to pay that much for their clothes"" says zara, throwing the potato back to the consumer. ""i'm too busy to think about stuff like this"" says the consumer...

my biggest aim in life is to have a problem solving attitude and sense of agency. there are certain associated advantages and disadvantages to those aims. the advantages are clear! the most important step in solving a problem is to try solutions! so if you try lots of solutions you eventually end up solving a few problems, even if the first solution isn't always the right one. the disadvantages are that sometimes you are terrible when people just need you to shut the fuck up and listen to how they feel rather than saying ""oh well, have you tried x, y and z"", which is a really annoying thing to say if someone just needs to be listened to. another disadvantage is you get incredibly, incredibly frustrated by the climate crisis because it seems the whole thing is caused by an entire planet of people saying there are zero solutions to this massive problem and when you say ""hey well what about trying this partial solution?"" they say ""oh no, no, that will never work! china is doing very wrong things and also amazon. now stop being ridiculous and get out of my way, i have to throw this potato to the government.""

i'm very, very far from doing everything perfectly, but i at least aim to live a life that i think one could reasonably live and, if the big players actually did their job, the earth might be ok. in the imaginary world i created in my head, using a great deal of imagination, the governments have done all they can to install systems that reduce carbon emissions and in return the proletariat have changed their lifestyle to eliminate those emissions which the governments could not eliminate by installing existing technologies and regulating private business. such a life involves eating mostly plants, so that’s what i do. there is nothing on the horizon that can possibly take care of our humongous meat problem. such a life involves taking my own containers and produce bags to the grocer and deli and buying unpackaged food, so i do that as well. there is no other solution to that problem, because plastic recycling is a lie and unfettered paper consumption being sustainable is another lie. so i bring my own bags, no big deal. i also try to not buy items and if i really, really want something, i try to buy it second hand, because probably there is nothing the system can do to make the enormous amount of things we buy sustainable. so i buy as few new physical things as i can, no problemo. such a life involves flying as little as possible so i take the train when i can, guiltily carbon offset when i can't and try to envision and work towards a life in which i don't need to fly. on the other hand, there is also a huge “system” going on, which i cannot fix and the only thing i can do about that is complain a lot to people who can do stuff about it and try to make sure my euros don’t feed it. so that’s what i do.

the thing that i want emphasise about this lifestyle is that the effort is largely front-loaded. it's like quitting cigarettes. you put in a big amount of effort for a couple of weeks or months and then it's just about not getting knocked off course. i spend a lot of my time thinking about the best way to convince people to just try, actually, because once people get over the mental hurdles of ""but i don't *want* to have to remember my keepcup"" or ""i don't *want* to adjust what i eat"" or ""i don't *want* to have to think about how much i drive"" they'll usually discover it's not so hard! i got on and off the horse for years, vegan for six months here, only buying second hand items for a year there and so on. i can say with confidence that the absolute hardest step is getting past your mind's defense system. it takes a huge effort to get over the thoughts of ""oh why should i have to do things when the developing countries are doing this and that and the government isn't doing such and such and jeff bezos exists and..."" but once you do it the first time it's like riding a bike! sure maybe you fall off, but getting back on is not half as difficult as it was the first time.

just because we take responsibility for our tiny bit doesn't mean that the big players will magically start taking responsibility for their huge bit. but the thing about hot potato is that if someone, anyone, just works up the courage to hold on to that potato then *the game is over*! if consumers say ""hey inditex, we're not going to buy your shit anymore unless you get your act together"" then the game of hot potato is over and inditex either stops this ridiculous greenwashing and actually gets its act together or inditex goes bankrupt. similarily, if people just stop eating so much meat and start eating beans instead of asking why the government keeps subsidising beef then *that* game of hot potato is over! the government will have to say ""god it appears that a big section of the population is no longer burger obsessed, maybe we can roll back the subsidies a bit and try for some points with these crazy tofu eaters?"" so just ask everyone you know to hold the potato! ask your friends, ask your local supermarkets, ask your family, ask the eu, ask your local politicians, everyone! shout at every single person or body you have access to ""please, the world is ending and we don't have time for this game anymore. please just hang onto the potato!"" and 95% of the time the answer will be more or less ""fuck off"" and that's ok! because 5% of the time people say ""by jove, you're right! shit, let's go. hey everyone hang on to your potato!"" did i take this metaphor too far? i think i pushed this one a bit. anyway, hopefully the meaning is clear.",0.9905

but i've noticed that there is the sentiment among green people that it is not the individuals, but the companies that are to blame for all the evil destruction around our planet, after all, they produce and pollute. individuals sure can withdraw from using straws, but in general, their impact is minuscule. while companies shift the blame to individuals, individuals also shift the blame to companies.

this is something that i've never fully agreed with, instinctively i felt it off. aren't companies in today's world merely a response to people's needs and perhaps a reflection of their ideals. 

assuming a free market will do their thing; reducing your needs and changing habits will force the companies to reduce their production and change their products if they still want to stay afloat. if people decide to buy a sustainable product from a sustainably aware and open competitor the evil and polluting company will have to change their ways or lose money. this is a very long-run approach and requires a collective of individuals, social awareness. 

obviously, the alternatives are not always there; someone in need of a cheap car would choose any car no matter how green the company producing it is. people with no access or no means to buy sustainable or recyclable products will buy other cheap replacements. 

i guess my view is a bit naively hopeful, but i've been wondering what is your view on this and perhaps show me something i don't see.",-0.985

1,"""electric cars will still create co2 emissions"" is a fallacy i've been discussing this a lot recently. many people are of the opinion that electric cars still result in emissions, just elsewhere - instead of co2 coming from the tailpipe of your car, it comes from a fossil fuel power plant.

while this is largely true *for now*, it is not necessarily true forever. as we move into the future, there's the possibility that we transition to fully renewable, zero-emission power generation. at that point, electric cars will actually have no correlated co2 emissions. there are lots of caveats i could get into about this, but for the sake of clarity i wont.

the argument that electric cars result in comparable emissions to internal combustion engines (ice) is a fallacy because it relies on the assumption that our power generation infrastructure will stay the same forever. there is no way an ice will *ever* be zero emissions, but there is a decent chance that in the future, electric cars will be zero emissions.

i also understand that carbon isn’t priced correctly due to lack of political will. from oil lobbying,  to popular opposition such as the yellow vest protests, to lack of international consensus— there are massive barriers to appropriate carbon pricing.

if we look past the practical issues though, there is another question that i don’t know the answer to. what is the appropriate price for carbon? there must be economists who have looked into this and developed an estimate for what a barrel of oil should cost to account for the current and future environmental impacts. is anyone on this sub familiar with this research?",-0.4392

1,"advice for pivoting careers to sustainability. leed ga exam? other certifications? just apply to every job? help hi everyone! i'm 25 working at an investment firm in the dc area (although i don't really know anything about investing, nor do i care much - just deal with data). i studied math in college and just barely missed my sustainability minor due to an issue with clearing an internship credit... but i left college intending to try to get any job remotely related to sustainability/environmental science/conservation/etc that i could. after a while of searching, part-time retail pay wasn't paying the bills so i expanded my search and ended up at the investment firm where i've now worked for 2+ years.

the job is pretty soul-sucking and it's about time for me to move on but i'm struggling with finding a clear path forward. prone to overthinking and perfectionism, i've waited so long to start applying to jobs because i'm afraid of being ""trapped"" in a similarly soul-sucking career (thinking: consulting \[but is that even a trap? i've heard mixed reviews\]) but i'm taking my therapists advice to not search for the perfect career and instead start by taking one step in the right direction (read: any job related to sustainability). i originally planned to start studying for the leed green associate exam with hopes of passing and leveraging that to a new position in a greener field, maybe even starting at usgbc. however... as i've started doing research on it, i've seen many say it's generally useless and not worth the money. although i'm no longer trying to look for the ""perfect"" job and i find leed interesting, i don't want to spend a big chunk of change on something that won't help. anyone have thoughts on the usefulness of leed ga or any other certifications? or any other advice for pivoting to sustainability?

for more context,  i have a couple internships from college under my belt related to sustainability, and even did my senior research project for my math degree on food waste and it's environmental impacts, but i'm a few years out of college and it's no longer the most relevant thing on my resume. even my stat skills and programming skills from my degree feel almost non-existent at this point. i'm incredibly confident in my ability to quickly learn (or relearn) and become a stand-out employee - but obviously i need to land a job first and the relevant experience on my resume feels a bit stale. maybe that's just me overthinking though! greatly appreciate any advice. thanks!",0.9791

tldr;  what would make the most environmental impact as an individual - buying  environmental friendly goods vs donating more money to environmental  groups?  if environmental groups - which ones do the most good/have the  potential to do the most good?

after  reading a documents and analysis over the last few years about slowing  down or possibly correcting climate change/environmental issues - it  seems individually or even as massive groups we really don't have nearly  as much impact as compared to industries.

hypothetically  speaking - could an individual do more good buying cheaper (non  environmentally products) and donate the annual difference (compared to  more expensive environmentally friendly) environmental groups that have  government lobby groups?  assuming the difference was around $100/month  (for buying nestle products, phosphate heavy laundry detergent, non fair  trade coffee, etc)

going on a  slightly larger scale if someone was coming from a low mpg vehicle and  bought a new vehicle - for environmental impact - would it make more  sense for that person to buy an economical gas car for 30k instead of  buying an electric car that would be around $50k and donating that $20k  difference to an environmental group with a strong lobby that could push  for better environmental regulations?

if this is the case, what are some environmental groups that have strong lobby groups?

i would like to one day build a home using that combination, however i have concerns about the sustainability of the heavy timbers required for structures. while they cost less energy to produce and construct, i am concerned that it incentivizes logging of old growth trees.

on many other fronts we are already being careful (i.e.: we became vegetarian/quasi-vegan in part for environmental reasons, we try to buy as much as possible second hand, clothes that we no longer wear are either donated or turned into rags, etc.). that being said, we do go to our cottage 4-6x a year (about 450km both ways, so 1,800km to 2,700km total), and we do travel once per year (with 2020 and 2021 being obvious exceptions). we want to find the best way to donate to have an immediate/measurable impact to offset this carbon footprint, but we also find it difficult to find convincing information on the subject.

so far, our three options are:

1) donate to organizations that plant trees. i'm not really sure this is that efficient, however.

2) donate to organizations who does carbon capture, like climeworks. our issues with this is twofold: (1) how legit are the numbers given (i.e.: x amount of tons of co2 removed for $y donation), and is it really the best way to go about it? it's like we are helping with a symptom more than the underlying issue.

3) donate to organizations who lobby for the sake of the environment, such as clean air task force. again, our issue with this is twofold: (1) are they remotely successful in their efforts? and (2) how can we directly measure the impact our donations are having?

i'm sure there are other ways. i would appreciate any guidance this sub can offer on the three ways we thought of, and on other ways we might not have.",0.9889

1,"help me reddit! exciting project name needed hi r/sustainability,

long story short is that i am fortunate enough to work on a project which has been awarded a substantial sum (multimillions over 5+ years) which is aiming to create exemplar sites which demonstrate sustainable water management on a catchment scale. some key points for context:

* this will be a project which heavily engages with communities and really seeks to champion local ownership of the benefits we want to create. we're also expecting to work with a diverse range of partners and stakeholders with shared interests/responsibilities. 
* the areas we're targeting are generally smaller, rural areas which would struggle to attract funding for these sorts of things in pretty much any other setting. there will only be a small number of communities (probably around 5-8) which are taken through to delivery since we really want to focus on strong, complete examples rather than a little bit spread over wide areas. 
* it's heavily linked to flood risk. the original idea is to capture flood water which is often just treated as ""waste"", store it, and give it a value doing by using it elsewhere. commoditising a natural waste product essentially. reducing flood risk to properties is a must for the project.
* seeking multiple benefits from lots of different subject areas also features heavily. this could be reduced domestic water consumption, improving hydrological catchment water quality, increasing/improving aquatic habitats, enriching curriculum in local schools to pass on messaging to kids etc etc.
* when submitted for funding approval the project was called ""holistic water management: revaluing flood water"". it's descriptive and served its purpose, but i think we can all agree its a bit mechanical.
* the project itself is basically a pilot. we're expected to be able to report back on what we found with the intention of demonstrating how water management could be done more sustainably in the future. theres a big emphasis on reporting, recording, and analysis over the duration of the programme of works. 
* the project is based in the uk in a region (which believe it or not) suffers with water scarcity along with flood risk - which is what fundamentally drove the idea in the first place.  

i'm super excited to be able to work on this because opportunities to deliver such a genuinely well intentioned, and unique project come around so rarely. but we need a name, and the project team is stuffed full of talented engineers and project managers who are not typically known for their branding creativity!

so i hoped reddit might be able to offer suggests for a name? short and snappy would be preferable. maybe it could be abbreviated into something clever? while i fully acknowledge that offering the internet a chance to name something like this is risky (cue rainy mcrain face...) i'm sure that loads of you are going to be much better at it than i am!",0.996

i noticed there are few reporting frameworks like gri, wri ghg protocol or iso 16064-1,2 and 3.

gri claims that 80% of the top companies use theirs. that it is comprehensive taking into account esg. but to me it looked pretty confusing and less practical for a company that actually wants to reduce ghg. its great if the objective is to prepare a complex report so people would feel great.

wri claims 9 of top 10 companies in the world use their standard. their seems to be easy to understand so may be more practical. 

both above are my opinions after reading about it from their sites. not from actual use.

to make matters worse iso has come out with 14064-1,2 and 3 which can be audited like other iso and get certified by them.

1,"carbon footprint of second hand products confession: i recently bought a new tv. 

i had a certain tv model in mind and made an effort to buy it pre-owned, but due to schedule related reasons i ended up buying it new, off the shelf. now i feel some climate-guilt for going the easy route as waiting to find a pre-owned one would have been the more sustainable way to get the tv. now i feel like the embodied carbon of the tv is completely on me, as by making the purchase i’ve effectively said ”yes lg, please
 make one more of these televisions and ship it to the other side of the globe”.

okay enough intro: the discussion i’d like to open, the question i’d appreciate your input on is this: what would have been the environmental impact of buying the tv as pre-owned? how much would you say buying a pre-owned tv increases a persons carbon footprint? clearly the amount is non-zero but it also seems clear that buying second-hand has a lesser impact compared to buying off the shelf. clearly the pre-owned tv has the same embodied carbon as a new one - it’s just that i wouldnt feel as responsible for it since it kind off wasn’t shipped from korea just for me. buying second hand, i wouldnt be increasing demand as directly as when buying off the shelf.

1,"what is the ideal bottling/packaging to go for in cosmetics? i was having a look online regarding the types of plastic that can be used to house cosmetics, whether it be for face or hair. i did want to start my own small shampoo brand one day. for bioplastics, i came across this after an episode of shark tank where a guy made a coffee machine and claimed the pods used are compostable in your garden. after having a further look, i read that it is more complicated than that. while plastics that state they are biodegradable such as polylactic acid (pla) or anything made from plant material, industrial composts only get this done effectively, meaning the plastic otherwise largely ends up in landfill. with that being said, i had some questions about this going further.

* with post consumer recycled plastic only being good for single use, although not requiring the energy as virgin plastic would, how do varying percentiles vary in terms of sustainability? i saw options online that had ranges from a cosmetic tube containing a range of options from 20-100% pcr plastic.
* what are biodegradable additives, and what difference does this make? while it is meant to be an accelerant for microorganisms to help with decomposition, is it really a gimmick given the problem of plastic waste?
* would hdpe plastic really be the way to go, as it is easily recyclable over and over again? i've seen some sites endorse this as an option for now. given of course that most bioplastics need industrial tech to decompose or rather end up in landfills.

my question is: if i buy the first one, that is cheaper and has better specs, and i keep it for 4 to 5 years, would it be better than buying a phone 3 times that price that already has lower specs and i might have to change sooner? am i really helping the environment or the people trading those materials by buying that phone? i'm kinda worried about the moral implications and would love to read your opinions and points of view around the capitalist market and these kinds of decisions.

i've been wondering this for quite some time. while you, me and our neighbor's family committing to a lifestyle and habit of reducing our impact on the impending ecological catastrophe is a great thing i think the overall impact of such actions and declarations is negligible at best. of course i realize it's all about consciousness and teaching ourselves and the next generations about how to live and let (the environment) live. but seeing charts and numbers and stats and you name it i'm well aware that our individual actions might be nothing more than a manifest and an example for others.

the way i see it is the real impact, the real action, lies way beyond our reach in the hands of people controlling the global ""economy"". the ""citizen responsibility"" propaganda is just another tactic which not only lessens the load on the government and corporation in the whole discourse but also keeps us—the small folk—distracted and busy,

look, i really don't want to diminish anyone's efforts in becoming more aware on the topic and changing the world just around themselves. there's no doubt it's immensely valuable in the long run. but here and now it seems to me it's not really significant enough. we, as in individual people, are not really responsible for anything, we're just a part of a system that is.

i mean, just looking at the reports of negative emissions, waste produce, permanent ecological damage etc. for me it's very clear that not only the responsibility but also the chance of any significant  impact lies well beyond reach of any individual person on this world.

so yeah, i keep wondering if there are any numbers on the actual predicted impact of every single household in the entire world going fully ""neutral"" for our planet. because i have this twitching feeling that what such report would say is that none of us are able to change the situation—even if it takes all of us.",-0.9307

one thing that absolutely blows my mind is the amount of plastic packaging materials we're throwing away every week. quite many things have been changing in this area in the past years but there's still a lot to be done.

can someone lead me to some businesses and openly available information on this topic? what types of bamboo are feasible (economically) to produce? what type of soil do they like? what is the yield in a continental (rather dry) climate? are there any know manufacturing methods that are especially good with bamboo?

i am in no way an expert so i'm trying to understand renewable energy better. from what i understand, solar panels are made from nonrenewable minerals, and have a lifespan of only about 30 years. wind turbines require a lot of steel and concrete, and the blades are usually made of plastic. they also only last about 30 years, and can harm wildlife. hydro also uses huge amounts of concrete, and disrupt ecosystems. nuclear energy of course produces radioactive waste.   


the only truly sustainable options i can think of are traditional windmills and water wheels made of wood, because wood is renewable indefinitely. and of course human powered tools (hand cranked, for example). but obviously these traditional methods are not nearly efficient enough to be used on a mass scale. should we go back to a low tech society so that we rely less on electricity? what are your thoughts on this?",-0.6197

1,"does not owning a vehicle offset never recycling? so i know someone who runs an electronics repair business and says that since he is a single dad and has 3 kids, he doesn't have time to take the e-waste he produces to the proper disposal location. and he says that since he would have to take recycling down 5 flights of stairs and walk across a large parking lot to reach the central recycling bins of the apartment complex he lives in, he never does recycling either and just throws everything in the garbage (there is central garbage disposal on each floor). however, he says that since he doesn't own a vehicle, therefore that alone more than offsets the amount of waste he has improperly disposed of. 

even though i am all about disposing waste properly, i emphasize with his situation and realize that it is not fair to force somebody in such life circumstances (of which it isn't their fault), to properly recycle. 

this got me thinking, since this is actually relevant to how wealthy ppl say that they recycle and compost much more than average, and often has the time and money to properly dispose waste (motor oil to a proper location, e-waste to a proper location, construction supplies to a specialized location, etc). however, since wealthy people often own more cars and drive more, and the cars they own often pollute more either due to high performance or physical materials (a rolls royce probably has a carbon footprint 10x larger than honda civic, for example), does the fact that they dispose of everything properly offset the fact that their lifestyle inherently pollutes more? 

and this also relates to the ""reduce, reuse, recycle"" order of importance whereas reduce has a larger impact than reuse, and reuse which in turn has a larger impact than recycle. i think the fact that the aforementioned person doesn't have a car, and lives in an apartment (not a nice one either, but realize that i am not judging him, just merely stating the facts) means that he is massively ""reducing"" which offsets how he is not recycling. 

finally, this also relates to the truth about how ppl in developing countries such as india, don't have large scale recycling facilities generally speaking, but since they don't buy much in the first place, and tend to have well-established reusing systems (families will pass items to another family, for example), developing countries have significantly lower carbon footprint per capita.",-0.6048

for a family of 5 my total emissions are 40 t/y. this is already much better than the average in my area per the calculator i used. but i think by reducing car use and making housing efficient, i can bring it down to maybe 10t/y. for this:

* move to washington state because the weather is relatively mild and as global warning rages, it would be livable for a long time. currently i am in ca and between draughts and fires, i think this state is going to be unlivable in my lifetime.
* housing should be built to offset its emissions completely. i have seen a project near la that is doing it, so it is possible. not looking to live a spartan life. would like to use tech to make things comfortable - solar panels, geo-thermal etc, 
* currently i have a single family home, and i think it is very inefficient. would like to live in a community where housing is dense and shopping, eating etc. is walkable. i immigrated from india and i really love this model. hate taking car out every time i need to buy milk or bread.
* work from home so that commute will also be avoided.
* do not live in big/expensive areas. prefer a community that is not as expensive as seattle area.
* housing to be built to a spec/code that can endure increasingly volatile weather of future. the houses and infra should be built to last several hundred years.

usually, i make my own drinks at home, however, on my recent trip, califia cold brew coffee bottles were reduced to 65c/bottle vs $4-5/bottle. it's about the same cost as me making it at home but it means more plastic in the home. another example is loose spinach which i purchase using my own produce bags. sometimes they have spinach bags reduced to $1/500g bag vs $13/kg. i re-purpose the plastic bag to hold waste or as a produce bag on my next trip.

even though i make a conscious effort, my mind goes through this thought process every time

* purchasing the item eliminates it from going to a landfill
* but the packaging it comes in (plastic most of the time) still goes to landfill
* this means i am supporting the business by purchasing their product

how can i stop this thought process on every trip?",-0.1865

i know there's a couple of posts on this sub about graduate programs but i am not from a sustainability background and wanted to get some thoughts on my situation.

i graduated 2 years ago with a business degree and went into management consulting. i've spent loads of time reflecting and feel really disillusioned by my overall job because it lacks purpose. i always knew i wanted to work in something with a positive social impact and i've discovered a keen passion for responsible supply chains, especially circularity in design and creating resilient value chains. i don't have any specific experience or credentials and think i need a masters to bridge this knowledge gap and help me transition towards something more meaningful work.

i have been thinking about masters programs that would be more practical and came across the msc in sustainability, enterprise, and environment at oxford. the word ""enterprise"" attracted me because it's really important i still stay close to the business side and have a way to apply what i learn quickly. the program looks pretty new (only launched last year) and has a pretty hefty price tag but i'm gravitating towards it because well, oxford. my questions:

1) any thoughts or stories about this program? since it's so new i haven't really found much on it 
2) any other practical masters programs worth looking into? i don't mind a bit of research but i see myself going back into consulting

a bit of background: i have a bachelor's in journalism. it was a great, really robust program, and i ended up going into marketing and currently work at an agency. however, i've found that marketing (especially at an agency) and journalism really aren't for me; marketing honestly feels skeevy/uninteresting, and job prospects in journalism are... not great!

i'm very into sustainability (specifically sustainable food systems), and i feel a career in this area would not only be more fulfilling and interesting, but will continue to be relevant far into the future for obvious reasons.

without a strong sciences background, though, is a master's like this even realistic? (i was a strong student throughout undergrad, but i've struggled a bit in the sciences, especially outside of biology, as well as in math.) if so, what kind of sustainability tracks/programs would be appropriate for someone with more of a liberal arts background?

my current set from corelle was discontinued a while ago and is way too expensive now on ebay to get used. so my plan is to purchase another set and offset that cost by selling what’s left of my current set on ebay.
here what i’m looking for and i would love some recommendations if you have some that you love:

-it has to be new. my husband has a thing against getting silverware/dinnerware used. i strongly disagree but he almost always changes things for me to be more sustainable, so i wanna respect his feelings there. 

-i’d like it to be super hard to break. i did manage to break a couple of my corelle pieces but it was quite good at being unbreakable. i’m just quite clumsy and some drops are inevitable. 

-dishwasher/microwave safe is a huge pro.

-i’d like to keep the overall cost down since we are getting a large set to avoid our current problem. the best i’ve found is about $10 a plate, but that will still be a bit pricey. 

-the reason i don’t wanna get corelle again is because i’m not a fan of their current designs. i love retro or minimal designs, and my husband wants anything  plain white.

of course we've done the easy tasks, high efficiency shower heads, led lighting, smart thermostats, recently replaced weather stripping, etc.  but looking at my next steps to be more environmentally responsible, i'd like to first get spray foam insulation blown in the attic.  my understanding is that it drastically improves the efficiency of a home.  then in a few years i plan on having the two hvac systems replaced with high efficiency units.  perhaps the power savings from those options will mean it'll be more viable to get a whole-home battery to use with the solar panels in the event of hurricanes knocking the power out, etc.  

these are obviously all larger cost investments that i'll have to spread out over a number of years, but i'm curious if folks more in the know feel that this is the best way or order of things to become more environmentally responsible.  and of course this goes hand in hand with trying my hand at hydroponics to grow my own vegetables, planting a small garden in back of the house, and consciously cutting down on waste.  ultimately i want to use fewer resources in the small space of this earth that i occupy.",0.9949

however, if you think about it, if everyone would want to fly at only 9€ there wouldn’t be a lot of flights, there would rather be no flights at all.

for an airline a 9€ doesn’t make money, not even for ryanair. therefore, by buying a 9€ flight you don’t really contribute to the demand as there is really limited supply for such cheap flights. it’s more flights that cost 50-100€ that drive the demand, not the rock bottom prices at below 20€ ryanair needs to make at least 40-50€ in revenue in order to break even.

in conclusion, if you hop on a 9€ flight you just make use of a flight that’s happening anyway, created by people who are willing to pay more. you make use of the supply that is already there but you do not drive demand.

i'm a consultant in central europe. part of my income is a company car, that gets changed every 4-5 years. i can opt out and receive either (a very small amount of) money or public transport/electric bike, however i'm then expected to be able to arrange transportation to my client based on that choice and, given that i change clients at variable frequencies (3mos to a year per client) and changing my transportation plan with my employer takes at least 1 month, i choose to stay with a car and will simply not use it if that's possible and my client is close by.

now, i'm due for a car change and my employer is offering three car models: petrol, non plug in hybrid and ev.

of course an ev has 0 emissions and given my area has quite some charging stations and i don't plan to drive more than 200km a day with it, that seems like a good fit. however i'm worried since i know producing an electric car has a high environmental cost which apparently isn't recovered if you don't use it enough. with working from home and given that i live in the capital (well connected, close to many possible clients) i think i'm likely to drive 100km/week max, though a situation in which i drive 800km/week is not impossible.

the hybrid on the other hand, since it isn't plug in, will mostly run on fuel as i'm driving on highways 90% of the time, as i only use my car for my work commute, if necessary. i read somewhere that hybrid cars use more fuel than other cars when they are running on fuel, but then i also read the opposite of that.

i don't know how to make this decision and most of the online comparisons i found consider things that don't apply to me, like the price of the car or tax cuts, or the number of car models in each category.

is my info correct? what would you do if you were me? do you have information about hybrid and ev cars that i didn't touch upon and you think could be useful? should i compare the environmental impact of the two precise car models instead of category (is that feasible)?

effective communication between us all and community based programmes would enforce changes rather than trying to persuade large corporations. if we spend a lot of time being reliant on changes from the top, i am concerned we'll slip into habits that just focus on what's the most convenient.

&#x200b;

i do like to concepts that are being suggested and having the system stress tested so that updated food chains and systems are resilient to economic, political and climate based changes but i'm not sure how realistic it is.

any thoughts??",0.8415

1,"packaging of products should be held to a ""bare minimum standard"" the packaging of products is extremely wasteful. slices of cheese with plastic in between every slice, some product in a plastic container which in turn has a paper over it and a sticker on top.

i wish there would be some kind of entity that would check every product and give it a ""bare minimum packaging limit"".
this would mean that it would take a look at the product and tell what the bare minimum of packaging would be to let the product exist, while taking into account consumersafety and protecting the product. i understand that this is where the producer will work hard to get their way: but it is for the safety of our consumer that its wrapped in plastic! or 'we'll have to throw away lots of damaged goods, thats worse than the plastic we'll use.' these things have to be looked at, but very critically.

also it would see if the materials that are used can be replaced by other, more sustainable materials.

so take the cheese. the producer says: we want to give the people 10 slices of cheese servings of such size and weight. it has to be fresh and not damaged. its important that the consumer can see the product. it should be easy to open and easy to use. 

the packaging entity: ok, it can have a transparant plastic container of so and so size, sealed off. you can add a logo and necessary consumer information. 

producer: we want slices of plastic in between and print an image of the cow. and put a sticker on it telling it has the ""best choice award"".

entity: not essential, rejected. 

terrible explanation. sorry. but i hope you get the gist. it would be great if this would be a worldwide thing, but that ofcourse is not realistic.",0.984

we're changing our default pensions provider to an ethical fund they provide and also get our energy from a green energy company (currently re-examining their claims as some so called 'green providers' just use certificates called rego's which potentially aren't as green as they first appear). one obvious place to improve is our packaging, currently recycled cardboard sheeting with edging and then plastic pallet-wrapped. we're looking to get all in one cardboard boxes made up from the same recycled cardboard provider though. and finally we're looking into setting up some kind of cycle scheme with our employees to reduce the reliance on either public transport or cars.

i've been working for a one of the largest international food services groups in the world for a little under a year. me and a manager a few levels above me have managed to secure the green light to plan and propose significant climate action within the group. at the moment the plans are in the ""ideation"" phase, but the support from the highest levels of the group are described as ""extremely enthusiastic""; apparently they feel like an environmental reckoning is coming and they want to get ahead of it. the group has over 55000 locations in over 45 countries that serve over 5.5 billion meals a year so the potential for this is huge.

with that said, i'd greatly appreciate any wisdom and knowledge you guys have in making food sustainable and pushing sustainability in large organizations.

here's some of what we have so far for reference:

* the group don't know when and where they emit carbon - our first steps will be to measure, estimate, and guess these values (in that order of preference)  

   * direct emissions: plant sensors in our locations to calculate carbon emissions from resources like gas and electricity.
   * secondary emissions: estimate carbon foot of supply chains e.g. food from local sources vs international, delivered by truck vs train etc.
   * waste: record how much food/water is wasted in warehouses and locations
* using the data:  

   * use location resource sensor readings to incentivize swap over to renewable suppliers and reduce overall usage.
   * conglomerate the data in a ""hub"" website/app with analytics to tell location/sector managers their ""carbon per meal"" and attempt to produce an app that would ""gamify"" managers reducing their carbon footprints. e.g. source your food more locally and get a discount or supply preference.
* other solutions:  

   * this hub could also be a place for the voices of all our workers to present their ideas to reduce waste and carbon emissions in the company. often the workers on the ground have the closest view of the waste that the company is creating and would have good ideas on how to do better. this could be incentivized.
   * massive amounts of food is potentially lost in warehouses, using a model to estimate when food will be wasted we could potentially price food to reduce the likelihood of it being wasted.
   * food waste could be composted and sent to organic farms (or better regenerative farms)

as you can tell, a lot of our ideas are data driven, we're from the data team so that's how our brains work; i feel very strongly, however, that data will only be part of this solution and we'll need people and perspective from everywhere to make this work.

things i'm struggling to come up with solutions for:

* how to incentivize organic or regeneratively grown produce, it's healthy and better for the environment by a mile but it's also often more expensive
* how to incentivize vegan or vegetarian food being served
* how to fight the ""plentiful"" fallacy: food sells much better if it appears plentiful. think of a buffet, the pasta looks a lot better when it heaped in a big pile vs the last scraps on the bottom of the serving pan. this causes huge amounts of food waste as you're nearly always throwing away full-ish pans at the end of day.

what techniques, skills, methods have you found were successful in your workplaces? all comments, thoughts, and experience welcome :)

edit:

i think a lot of the effective solutions will be fighting human psychology e.g. avoiding the ""plentiful"" fallacy as mentioned above, or convincing a buyer that they don't need double stock and that it's predicted they will only need 1.2x stock when making their orders, etc.",0.9933

1,"low- or equivalent-cost sustainable swaps? i've been looking at sustainable and low-waste solutions with hearts in my eyes for years. i adore the concept, and would really love to be a part of a change for good.

except... i don't make a ton of money. most of the available sustainable products and solutions simply aren't *financially* sustainable for me. and it honestly breaks my heart. i want to be a part of this and do what i can, but i *can't.* it reasonably makes enough sense that there's a cost involved with doing the right thing for the planet, but what about those of us who can't afford it?

as an example, the most recent thing i looked into was who gives a crap toilet paper. the best deal you can get from them levels out to $1/roll (plus $4.20 for shipping). which doesn't seem too bad upfront, until i remember that i currently get 12 rolls at the local grocery store for $2.50, and spend the rest of the difference on *food and such.*

what are some sustainable lifestyle changes that *don't* have an upcharge? what sustainable options are truly available to *everyone* in the same capacity?

***and now, a fun discussion question:***

i know it's been well-discussed that the sustainable option is nearly always more expensive, almost making sustainability a privilege exclusive to those who can afford it. but does anyone see that changing in the future? will there always be an additional cost associated with this? i keep telling myself that part of it must be business costs – namely marketing to people who don't know your product is an option. but i don't know that i'm convinced that this will ever level itself back out. i'd love to hear some other takes on this!",0.9908
1,"reduce food waste tips some people on here might just be getting started on being more sustainable. here are my best tips on reducing your food waste. it is easy to get started.

* love your leftovers! make food that you want to eat more than once rather than throwing out what is left when the meal is over.
* expiration dates aren’t always exactly right. use your best judgement!
* keep track of what is in your fridge and pantry. this will ensure you don’t buy too much and you know what you have to work with.
* use prep scraps (apple cores, veggie peels, etc.) for other projects such as making a homemade broth.
* don’t forget to compost!

1,"which way of recycling is better? i am in argument with my brother about the best way to get the most out of people’s recycling habits. 
i am in favour of having several bins: one for paper, one for the plastic, one for glass etc. like they have in germany. 
but in paris london and many big cities, there is often one recycling bin that accepts everything. recycling centres then differentiate between the different materials. 
my brother’s point of view is that it allows people to not really do the thinking and allow for one bin instead of 4 or 5 in cities where space is scarce. 
i am pretty sure that the cost and the % of recycled materials is lowered with a single bin (paper/cartons get spoiled, other material can get damaged?) and more expensive (high price for machines capable of doing what people don’t) but in cities like paris and london where space is limited and where most people are not willing to make too many efforts, it could make sense. 

getting the right thing could prove useful as my brother is involved in local politics. 

does anyone have a study on the matter or an educated opinion?

did research & found a solution.  milled asphalt.  it's ground-up asphalt from old parking lots, roads, etc.  they simply lay it down and flatten it.  

no asphalt smell.  you can drive on it almost immediately.  and it lasts for over 20 years.

it's cheaper than new asphalt, requires less equipment.

and it's more durable than new asphalt. 

i saved 4 dump truck loads of old asphalt from the landfill (i have a long driveway), saved money, prevented future downstream drainage issues.

there's no smell, they don't have to heat it up like new asphalt.  there's no tar.  once compacted, the milled asphalt becomes even harder over time.

1,"getting beat down by a career in sustainability. don't really know what other sub to go to. 

i have worked really hard to find quality, impactful jobs that pertain to sustainable development. my undergrad is in literally, sustainability. i started as a coordinator for an urban farm and classroom, became a neighborhood revitalization specialist, then worked for a sustainable aid organization, as a director, that sent refurbished, repaired, and reprogrammed medical equipment discarded by american companies to developing nations. for the past few years, i worked to create a green business certification and consulted for hundreds of local businesses for a local business coalition and now i am assisting with research for the un in regards to sustainable sourcing. 

i recently realized that without a masters, i will not be able to find a job within the sustainability field for more than 40k. i have a decent amount of experience in international sustainable supply chain, event planning, marketing, consulting, budgeting, grassroots organizing, managing volunteers, and more. 

the top sustainability jobs go to people in the business world who have been there for decades who have some interest in sustainability. it does not go to people who learn about systems thinking, grassroots organization, triple bottom line thinking. it goes to the old guard, they surely know more than me in some things, but i chump it up to greenwashing. the other element is the wide variety of quality sustainability jobs (you know, not just selling solar panels or working at an urban garden). some require 10 years of business experience for a sustainability manager job, and there is usually only one, if that, at a company. people who have worked in business for 10 years probably do not have a comprehensive understanding of sustainability. just greenwashing and advertising of it. then some require gis, digital marketing skills etc etc. i can't keep up, if i hone one skill the next job opening that is decent will require another one.

i am tired of trying. just got a message that i didn't past a prescreening for a job that would have profoundly increased my income and impact. it was right in my wheelhouse, the dream job. it's just disappointing. there were five levels of interview, i didn't make it past a second look. i do not feel comfortable changing my career, knowing what is at stake, but boy is this just....hurting.",-0.8347

see this as a psa or a discussion (has this ever happened to you??), but i just wanted to share my realization that it's really hard to plant new trees on the cheap in my neighborhood because it's dominated by two invasive trees: the sycamore maple and norway maple.

now of course you can always go to a garden store and buy a tree but at ~$100 a pop, it's not the most economical move (not to mention transportability!). (or buy a tiny seedling online for cheap and hope for the best...) but i'm in no rush and happen to enjoy propagating or growing plants from seeds and seedlings and i was excited to have these various seedlings appear in my yard so i could raise them, but months later, i had the bright idea to try to identify the exact types of maples these were and lo, they turned out to be the invasive sycamore maple (totally explains why they are so plentiful). and then i did it again with a different maple months later! mistaking what i thought was a ""normal"" maple (native sugar maple) with the eerily similar norway maple 😓

however, all the clothes i can find in thrift stores are.... ugly. lol. and i've seen people do some thrift flips or pair a top i would have thought was ugly in a particular way with the rest of their outfit so that it looks really cute, but i have a terrible eye for that type of thing. or they're able to take old ""out of date"" clothes and either alter them or wear them in such a way that they look more modern. 

 one thing that's so alluring about clothing stores or fast fashion stores for me is the way they set up mannequins and the employees wear the clothes, so you can see pieces being utilized and know what looks good together. 

on top of that, it takes a million years to thrift because you basically have to spend forever sifting through clothes until you find something you like that would actually fit. 

so, for someone who doesn't have a great eye and doesn't like to spend a long time shopping, what are your tips? or are there any sellers online you know of who upcycle clothes in a cute way that i can support?",0.9281

1,"if recycling is a scam, then what should i do? *before we begin, i should make clear that i'm not us-based. sorry for the eventual mistakes, hope i can communicate well regardless.*  
**\*tl;dr at the end.**

so... first things first. since earlier this year, i have been consuming more and more information about climate change, sustainability, these important kind of things - and it has led me to be more environment-conscious than ever.   
thing is: i live in a rather dysfunctional home. i'm 22, and (unfortunately!) still live with my parents, who are... how should i say... *less than fun* to live with. they are very difficult people for a whole lot of reasons, but i'll stick to the earth-damaging bit here. 

**mother**  
my mother is freaky about cleaning everything all the time to the point that it often becomes unhealthy. almost like by consequence, she also waste very, very much paper and plastic. and a lot more things, to be sincere.  
with ""very"" i mean: every time she wash her hands she dries it up with paper towel. every time she drinks water she uses a new disposable plastic cup. every time she comes home she puts her used clothes in a plastic bag... i could go on and on. she truly is a waste machine.   
mom is also one of the most arrogant beings that i've ever met — so you know that ""trying to talk her out of it"" is not an option. in fact, i've been there, tried that, was involved in major family ~~havoc~~ conflicts, gave up. well, using disposable itens is apparently very important for her to feel clean. 

**father**  
i also live with my father, who is (and has always been) a very permissive man. he longs for peace and silence, mom is very angry, stressed and loud all the time. this situation led him to do everything in his power to keep balance and avoid conflict. since i was a kid, he's always instructed me to do the same. it means, among **a lot** of other things, that he also does that kind of wasteful things for her. including things like letting a alcohol-wet paper towel near things, so she knows that the item has already been cleaned up. x)  
recently, he became worse. dad is very prone to any kind of conspiracy, and, in the last couple months, he's been watching videos of a ""professor"" who is — brace yourself! — openly anti-sustainability. yes, that man says that ""the lie of sustainability"" will end humanity, that it is a government-communist-globalist project of power/control... well, i don't know details, but i guess you got the point already.  
so, problem is: he was already damaging before he was watching those kind of things, and now he is almost porpusefully wasteful. in fact, he even keeps me from being openly ecofriendly.  
although he's very different from mom, he's also very pedant and arrogant in his own way, so trying to talk him out of it is also a no-no. 

**what i've been trying to do**  
at this point, you may have guessed that i'm considering moving out as soon as it becomes financially possible for me, which, sadly, can take some time. i need to save around \~$20,000 to safely move out, and it is a lot of money to reach around here! oof!  
well, truth is that i'll have to stick in here for some more time  — becaus of it, i've been thinking about adopting a harm-reduction-policy. i won't be able to switch to full zero-waste for as long as i'm at my parents, but i'll try to do what i can (without getting involved in any more fights, i hope).  
silently using specific cloths for what they love to use paper towels; try to buy things only if strictly necessary and at the highest volume possible, so i can avoid financing more plastic packages; separating the trash so i can send to recycle centers... what, wait. recyling is a scam?? what do i do, then?!  
i really want to do my part. i'm sure that when i move out i'll be able to be anything that i want, including the ecofriendly independent pretty woman i've wanted to be for so long, but... while i'm here, what the heck should i do (or not do)? i'm looking for little things that i can discreetly incorporate in my routines that should reduce impact — without it being an empty work.  
this piece of information about recycling really made me lose perspective on what i should focus on while i'm on this damage-management regimen.   


**\*tl;dr:**  i've read that recycling is a scam and i'm not sure on what can i do then. my parents are anti-enviromentalists and keep me from living sustainably. i need input about what can i do to reduce environmental harm when i'm in a situation where i can do almost nothing.   


*disclaimer: please, don't suggest anything in the lines of ""confront them! be courageous!"".*   
*it may be a weakness of mine, but at the moment i really don't have the mental and physical health to do that anymore. it is always more than stressful and it has never have never been worth it. i'm not in my best self right now, so, i'll try to reduce damage in this part of my life too.*",-0.9957

1,"if one was to start an environmental corporation asking for your opinion on feasibility/opportunities:

i've been playing with idea of starting an company focused on environmental services. most conservation and sustainability efforts are government and organisational efforts that seem to have little impact and are slow to be acted upon. and corporations are generally money-making machines that run more efficiently.

if there was a company that aimed at creating jobs in conservation/sustainability, with services like replantation, reclamation of degraded land (perhaps even the oceans), the revenue could be funneled back into protecting the earth and any growth for the company would mean increased conservation efforts. it's like a twist on private conservation effort that could include indigenous people, create green jobs and ultimately create a better earth. 

however, there are a few key points that need to be addressed:

1. revenue: how would it generate income? 
the land by itself would not generate any income. one could implement sustainable farming practices, create private protected areas that are accessible to the public for a fee. the land would thus increase in value over time, but such a venture would probably be a loss-generating initiative. 
there are government contracts that tender conservation projects, which could be a source of income. however, these are generally solicited by the government and will not necessarily be asking to provide the same services as the company.


2. investment: who would invest and how much?
if the company got started and went on to have an ipo, it is hopeful that it will raise quite a bit of money. i think people would be willing to invest in 'green stocks' and see it go up in value. however, i think it will mostly generate loss and there won't be much dividends paid out to investors. still, there are billion-dollar companies that basically don't make profit, so as long as the company exists, it could continue doing what it does.

here's some alternatives that i could think about:

-lab grown meat: i know it exists but i couldn't find much about it. i expect it to be hella expensive and hard to find so it's probably a no go.
-game meat: still expensive but definitely easier to find, plus my so loves it. while it still involves killing animals it eliminates the ethical and sustainability problems of intensive farming. i'm aware that if this was done on a large scale it would immediately stop being sustainable so i'm not sure about it.
-buying from small farmers: possibly the cheapest but least sustainable option, but i guess making sure that the animals are farmed correctly is at least a good starting point. and at least i wouldn't be giving my money to a multinational corporation. this step is possibly the only one that would work with eggs and dairy too.

i honestly never thought much about it and i'm not really an expert in the field, so i would really appreciate appreciate some input. if this information can help, we live in central europe.",0.9488

we all want cleaner tech, higher efficiency, less waste and made from new materials, and build a better future for poorer peoples in the world... but the materials to build those inevitably have to come from the resource industries. and yet people are very anti-oil and anti-mining but that makes no sense to me. we need those industries. so why would we force them out of our own countries just to have the job done even less sustainably and with poorer enviro protection abroad?

my grandfather used to say: 

""anything that we can't grow in a field or catch in the sea has to be taken from the earth.""

1,"food waste discrimination & planned obsolescence the 2019 hunger index ranked india 102 out of 117 qualifying countries. india scored 30.3 which means india suffers from a serious hunger problem. according to un estimates 40% of all food produced in india is either lost or wasted. 69% of all deaths of children under the age of five is caused by malnutrition.  

finish what on your plate, there are people dying of hunger in our country because they don’t get one nourishing square meal a day! those are the spoken words of my mother that i got to hear when i was a child trying hard to finish what’s on plate at the dinner table. 

i can keep stating facts that any one of you can verify by doing a simple search on google. better, to get a full visual and emotional impact of how grave this problem is, you can choose to visit one of the many urban slums or take a drive to poorer parts of rural india to experience the state of affairs first hand.

food is wasted in numerous ways, some of which is not directly under our control, but some definitely is. here are some of the ways in which households and individuals can drastically reduce the amount of food they waste.  

food discrimination: yes, food discrimination is real and it’s a consumer driven problem. the demand for perfect looking fruits and vegetables from consumers is a major cause as to why supermarkets & neighborhood stores reject produce with slight deformities or blemishes, even though the produce is perfect for consumption. this is what we call the halo effect, which is a form of cognitive bias. he is handsome, hence he must be smart, she is beautiful thus she must be super confident, this apple has blemishes on it, hence it is not fit for consumption. 

as consumers we need to start making educated decisions by consciously bypassing this cognitive bias of ours and remember that the produce is being bought for consumption (unless you have other plans) and a few blemishes, some deformities will not make it any less nourishing than perfect looking produce. in fact, in many cases over ripe fruits are better for your health as is the case with bananas. you must also be aware that many fruits and vegetables being sold in the market that look perfect have been made to do so through coercive and harmful means. an apt example of such a practice is polishing apples, colouring strawberries & dipping ginger in acid too remove blemishes. not much different than photo shopping your picture. 

planned obsolescence: the definition of planned obsolescence is “in economics and industrial design, planned obsolescence is a policy of planning or designing a product with an artificially limited useful life, so that it becomes obsolete after a certain period of time.” this is evident specially in electronic goods like tv’s, cell phones, computers and is also rampant in the fashion industry as evident with ever changing styles and the massive growth of fast fashion at large. but the same concept is also applicable to the packaged food industry. best before dates are really meant to tell you when the food tastes best, not when it will go bad. baby food is the only product where you need to pay attention to expiry dates. here is a list of food products that you can consume post their expiry dates as long as you follow the following precautions: 

1.     cake mix: can be used four to five months post expiry dates as long as you store it in a cool and dry place. 

2.     milk: can last fifty percent longer than the date of expiry mentioned on the packet or carton if it is stored at a colder temperature at the back of the fridge, as compared to the front where the door is constantly opened and closed. if it’s pasteurized it can last even longer. as long as it does not smell, it’s good to consume.   

3.     honey: the look of honey may change over time, but it does not really spoil. store honey in its original jar or bottle and do not store it in a dark place or pantry. if it crystallises, just run it under some hot water or put in a bowl of hot water and it will take its original form and colour. 

4.     canned goods: food packaged in cans generally have a shelf like of about three years, but can be consumed for up to four years post the expiry date. store canned goods in a cool dry spot. if you see dents, leakage or rusting it’s time to get dispose them. 

5.     hard cheese: cheddar and parmesan is good to consume almost a month past its expiry date. if you see mould forming on part of the cheese, simply cut it out and use the good portion 

6.     eggs: expiry dates on the egg cartons don’t always reveal the truth and most of us end up denying ourselves a perfectly edible omelette! here how you check if the egg can still be consumed without cracking it open. simply place it in bowl of water to check it buoyancy. if it sinks, it’s still good to eat and if it floats chuck it in your composter. 

7.     bread: the expiry date mentioned on breads is assuming that you are storing it on your counter. this date can be extended by upwards of two weeks by storing it in your fridge or freezer. as long as you don’t see mould growing on it’s safe to consume. 

8.     butter: the best before date on butter is applicable once you have thawed it. want to make your butter last longer, simple keep it in your freezer. 

9.     yogurt: if unopened, yogurt is safe to eat up to one week past its expiry date if stored in your fridge soon after purchasing it. yogurt can also be frozen for upwards of two months. excess water on the top and curdling at the bottom means that the yogurt is past its prime and it’s time to dispose of it. 

10.  dry pasta: generally has a shelf like of two years, but can easily be consumed one year post its expiry date. 

11.  frozen food: frozen fruits & vegetables are good to consume past their expiry date. they might get freezer burn and may not be as good tasting, but they are good to consume. 

12.  cookies crackers & chips: these items may taste stale, but as long as they don’t smell funny they are good to consume. for cookies as long as they don’t smell funny, are kept in air tight containers and don’t crumble in your hands easily, they can still be consumed. make sure that they don’t smell funny! 

13.  chocolate: can last up wards of eight months post its expiry date depending on how it’s been stored. store them in a tightly sealed container in the fridge or you can store it in your freezer in an air tight container for almost two years. fat or sugar bloom, the spotty look on your chocolate is not mould, the chocolate can still be consumed (may not taste as good) or used for baking.

14.  ketchup & mustard: unopened ketchup can be consumed up to one year past it’s date of expiry and once opened if stored in the fridge can be consumed within six months. mustard on the other hand can be stored for two years up un opened past its expiry date or one year past its expiry date if open and stored in the fridge. 

15.  cereal: cereal is ok to consume almost six months post its expiry date, as long as you are ok with consume stale tasting cereal and put your sustainability commitment to test. 

the important thing to remember here is that composting is the last option, only to be utilised to recycle post-consumer food waste. the goal should be to reduce wastage through a process of informed consumption and purchase decision making. hopefully this article has shed light on how planned obsolesce and food discrimination are a major cause of food wastage and individual choices that you can make today for a better tomorrow. 

here are some great resources to learn more about this subject:

i'm posting this post to get some ideas from people who work in sustainability.

a little background about me.

i'm a software developer. i had worked with a software platform that helps sustainability reporting of corporate.

as per my understanding, there are a lot of companies that assess sustainability aspects.not all companies don't do auditing. 

 i also got to know the sustainability reporting is very expensive and requires a certain amount of resources.

 another fact i noticed is the companies do sustainability reporting annually, they just stop their reporting to compiling a report and just published them. the amount of work they do is not usually visible to the customers or end-users.

 these reports/ the activities which are done by the companies towards sustainability are not visible to end-users or consumers.

i had some chances to work with planting, finance, and manufacturing industries.

the companies i had worked with did a very good job to reduce co2 emissions. i'm also a consumer of their services.

until i worked with them, i wasn't aware of their sustainability activities.

i feel like there is a gap between sustainability reporting and the awareness of end-users. do you guys agree?

what i'm thinking is to reduce the gap, so the companies which are environmentally friendly would attract more consumers/end-users.

what do guys think about my idea? please share your opinions.

this confuses me though. because wouldn't that rainwater otherwise go to watering wild vegetation instead of monoculture crops?

so when we use water  that would otherwise go to wild vegetation, is that not a negative?

in esg investing, there is the difficulty in assuring the validity of the esg-actions claims of an organization. the difficulty in verification leads to something called greenwashing. greenwashing is when a company claims a practice they employ is environmentally friendly or beneficial when it is not. the claims are intentionally misleading, generally so the organization can escape shifting revenues towards a carbon neutral/negative mission. 

 to phrase as a question: ""is this organization actually using energy produced by sustainable methods, therefore contributing to the global effort to transition away from energy produced by fossil fuels? or are they claiming to do this only to maintain/increase its sustainability rating thus improving it's roi to investors?""

organizations need power. power is created by several different power generating facilities and then stored/distributed through the grid. all of the power in the grid is mixed together. there is no way as of right now to verify whether the power in the grid has been generated by coal based power plants or by a wind farm. 

organizations will purchase this power and then also buy recs (renewable energy certificates) which grants them the right to say they purchased sustainably produced electricity. in actuality, they have not purchased electricity that is any different than what you or i or any other organization, without the rec's have purchased. it is the same electricity, from the grid, all mixed together. an organization that purchases rec's and then uses power from the grid, to increase its sustainability rating, is engaging in a process called greenwashing. 

this is where the introduction of nft's can can be useful to verification of grid-obtained energy. an nft or non-fungible token is a unique identifier for something either tangible or intangible. nft's are traceable and verifiable because they are built on blockchain technology (a distributed public ledger). if an nft was assigned to the electricity produced from a wind farm, an organization could then purchase that energy and also purchase a linked nft in the form of a rec and verify the legitimacy of the source of their energy. this use of nfts as recs can help mitigate the act of greenwashing in organizations.",0.9693

you get points based on the support on your videos, and there will be rewards for the points later on.

1,"sustainable shaving tips? hello there! lately, i've been looking forward decreasing the amount of waste i produce, and i've met some difficulties when it comes to shaving. let me explain a bit why:

i usually use shaving foam for comfort (the one in alluminium tubes), an electric rasor to get most of the 3 and a half hairs away, and the finishing touch with some disposable razor (booh!), afterward, depending on how much i butchered my face, i use some aftershave.

now, my problems are as that i'm softskinned, inexperienced in shaving and clumsy. so i don't think i could get rid of the shaving foam (it stings to not use it :( ), but i could totally go for a more sustainable product that would hold the same purpose, i am bad at shaving as a whole, and for now i can't get close shaved without a disposable blade (i'm working on that) and i don't intend to use a barber's razor as i would 100% hurt myself by accident with it, and i don't intend to test the quality of the emergency service at the hospital.

so if you have any good advice on shaving sustainabily (or shaving as a whole. i'm really bad at it) that are foolproof (and eventually not really pricey and not hard to find), i'll take it as well as some products recomandation.

let's start from the problem: i am tired of witnessing the prominence of inflammatory rants, low-information posts, simplistic slogans, unsubstantiated discussions and cliché memes in this subreddit. i know that i am not alone. more important than our being irritated, i submit that **currently, the time and energy of readers and writers here are hugely wasted, when we sorely need them to be applied constructively** (and that would make us happier, too)**.** in other words, r/sustainability lives well below its potential. as things are, the visible discussions here have lower average quality than a at political party convention.  


most of it is either common sense or reddiquette, but let's recall some **guidelines for sane content:**

1. **don't upvote just because you agree.** upvoting is for boosting visibility: it is meant to assert that in the current context, this piece of content likely merits one of the very few slots in the reader's attention span. the intention behind upvoting should be *""this enriches the discussion and is worth your time""*, not *""yeeeaaaaaah preaaaach!!!!""*.
2. corollary: **don't upvote unconstructive posts,** even if they resonate. when people mindlessly amplify the messages that resonate, it's called an echo chamber.
3. **don't downvote just because you disagree.** downvoting is silencing: it's sometimes warranted, but it's exclusive, and should be a last-resort measure against unequivocally inappropriate content. downvoting means *""this doesn't belong here""*, not *""i disagree""*. if you disagree about a something, write a comment challenging it, or upvote one.
4. **refrain from writing knee-jerk reactions.** we can always do better.
5. **think twice before posting.** take the stoics' advice: ""isn't it better left unsaid?"". regarding the contents posted here, we would all be much better off with **more quality, less quantity.** *(oh hey, look at that, we have the same advice for material consumption, isn't that beautiful?)*.
6. **don't express yourself violently.** it's not useful here.
7. **substantiate your arguments.** take the time to write thoughtfully, and provide verifiable evidence when possible.

a well-functioning online forum does not look like a choir or an arena. it's a high-conductivity social network for conveying knowledge, empathy and ideas.

i've been talking about avoiding the promotion of bad content. so what should we promote instead? well, as i said, there's no reason to aim for today's throughput of publication. still, here are some ideas:

1. **insightful, solid, methodical information** describing sustainability-related issues or shedding light on how to address them.
2. co-creating corpora of **communication materials for activism**, as well as **plans for transitioning towards sustainability.**
3. sharing **practical advice** for sustainability at an individual level.
4. **political debates,** aimed at achieving consensus on a hierarchy of needs and desirable actions.
5. **training for political debates** outside of this community.
6. non-violent sharing of **feelings and emotional support.** (preferably condensed in a few dedicated threads, please).
7. organizing **study groups**.

**note to moderators:** maybe some of these guidelines and recommendations belong in the community rules sidebar?

  
one could argue that i'm being elitist here, and that if i'm not happy i can join or create some other community that has higher standards. i see 2 reasons why this doesn't hold. first, it's not elitist to call for thoughtful discussion - if you ask me, suggesting it's elitist is underestimating people's potential for thoughtful discussion. second, by its very name, r/sustainability claims to be *the* subreddit for sustainability, and that position comes with certain responsibilities. si i submit that it's the other way around: **when people just need to vent off (which they legitimately do), they should do it somewhere else** (e.g in r/sustainbilityventingoff).  


i sympathize with the suffering and human traits that have led to the behaviours i'm criticizing, and i hope it's clear that **i blame nobody in this community**. i'm not excluding myself from this criticism. i hope this post will contribute to improving things. it is demanding, i know, but that's out of respect for people's time, and because the stakes are high.

1,"how to be more sustainable... from someone who works in retail i currently work in a large supermarket in the uk, so this list won't be applicable to everyone, and some points are pretty basic, but hopefully it will be of use to some people :)

&#x200b;

* **there is so.much.food.waste** \- if you can, buy single banana's (as these always get left and thrown out) and buy shorter dated food (good for if you're going to freeze/eat that day anyway). also any produce with a bump/bruise/doesn't look pretty often gets thrown out. before i worked in retail i kind of assumed all the food gets sold or the employees get to take it home if it's still fine but technically out of date... but nope. honestly some days i wonder how we make a profit. unfortunately most of my colleagues don't rotate stock properly and this is contributing to the issue. i also see a lot of stock arrive in store damaged as it hasn't been properly packaged. 
* **buy items/food with damaged packaging** \- anything whereby a seal etc is compromised shouldn't be on the shelf, but i see lots of items with a slight cosmetic damage to the packaging sit on the shelf for months and eventually thrown away. i've seen people in need of a specific item, and choose not to buy it because there's only 3 left in a slightly crumpled cardboard box. in my store we offer a small discount for such damage, but items are still largely unsold. 
* **if you decide you don't want a chilled/frozen item you've picked up, put it back in a fridge/freezer.** so many people just leave chilled items on a shelf and then we have to throw it away. 
* **shelf packaging can be deceiving** \- my store sells toilet rolls in paper wrap... that arrive in store covered in plastic wrap. we sell glass bottles that arrive in boxes with protective plastic inserts. it might be worth asking store staff how a product arrives in store in order to make an informed choice as to which is the more sustainable packaging option. (of course package-free is always best, but not accessible to everyone).
* **research how to properly store food at home** \- sometimes storing things it's original packaging isn't best (e.g. i always put a papertowel in with my salad, and if it's compacted into a bag i separate it into 2 containers). 
* **buy loose produce** \- for lots of things this often works out a little cheaper too. in my store we sell 3 onions in a net bag for around 60p, buying them loose is around 40p.
* **bring re-usable carrier bags/produce bags** \- i personally don't use produce bags, i just pop items straight into my trolley and then later into a carrier bag. the amount of people i see with a single onion in a plastic bag utterly baffles me. 
* **avoid using the produce weighing machines that produce a barcode sticker** \- just weigh produce on a self-serve check-out, or a manned check-out and there's no need for a sticker. 
* **try to avoid returning items that cannot be resold** \- in a clothes shop i worked at previously, we would accept underwear returns, but even if the packaging was sealed/hygiene strips intact, we had to send it off to be destroyed. 
* **try not to 'dirty' clothes when trying them on in-store** \- again, in the clothes shop i worked at, we often had dresses and tops with foundation stains around the neck, and even with a discount these items would largely remain unsold.

of course buying local/second hand/direct from the producer or farmer and package-free is better :)",0.9589

1,"given the urgency of the situation, democracy can't work unpopular opinion i know, especially since most of the western world has been conditioned to believe that democracy is the only valid form of government.

the problem with democracy is that the dumbest person has the same power as the smartest. efficient organizations don't – can't – work this way (businesses, military, whatever). rather, you have the best and smartest making the decisions, and the others following their leadership. and that entirely makes sense. how can you expect someone objectively less intelligent to make the right decisions? 

the danger here is that you can be smart and selfish. when someone smart and selfish, or even malevolent, comes into power... we all know how that ends.

we need a wwii-level of effort to curb climate change, and we simply can't have that with democracy; it's going to take too long. we have what, 30 years left? consumerism is too engrained in our society, people will literally need to be out of water to realize this is real.

1,"veganism has nothing to do with sustainability. here comes the truth again you useless wankers. imagine two parallel worlds that branched from our own 1000 years ago.

in one of these - let's call it ""limitworld"", the people in charge decided (rather like the chinese in the 1980s) to set absolute limits to the population and to consumption levels. they make it sacrosanct law that the human population must never exceed 1 billion, and also that nobody can be permitted to become super-rich and vastly overconsume as an individual. in the other - ""veganworld"" - the people in charge decided (more like the indians) that everybody must be vegan. they make it illegal and culturally unacceptable for anybody to eat animal products.

what do you think would happen in these two parallel worlds? the answer could not be clearer.

in limitworld there will either be no ecological collapse at all, or it will happen much more slowly and be much easier to fix. limitworld at least has a decent shot at genuine sustainability. meanwhile, in veganworld, the human population level would already be considerably higher than in our own world. that would be because the vegan system of food production permitted considerably more people, globally, to be alive at one time before significant numbers start dying of starvation. veganworld, therefore, isn't even as sustainable as our own world. they would literally be in even more trouble than us, because those extra couple of billion people will still need somewhere to live, still need to use transport, etc...

i respectfully ask that you deal with the actual point i am making, and do not try to further derail this discussion with counter-arguments that do not affect this one.

limiting population and consumption doesn't merely ""contribute"" to sustainability. it's the single most critical factor. without it, there can be no sustainability. veganism, on the other hand, doesn't contribute at all. a vegan world with no limits would be less, not more, sustainable than our own..",-0.764

my alternative is riding my bike 15 minutes to a bus stop and then taking the bus for 25 minutes, which would triple my total commute time because our city doesn't give a shit about transit riders. i'm going to give it a shot to see if i can handle it at least a few days a week.

we desperately need to normalize remote work and massively expand and destigmatize riding the bus and biking to work. this also got me thinking about how more democratically controlled workplaces would help too. if the workers were unionized or the firm was a co-op, we could vote or tell our management that we want to stay remote or do hybrid work - but we have no power in this system.",0.5676

sustainability is about the creation of hunan systems which are compatible with the ecosystem. for most of human history, we were hunter-gatherers who ate a meat-heavy diet. and for the whole of this time, that system was sustainable. it was compatibile with the holocene ecosystem.  well...that's not entirely true, because there was a long-term pattern of extinction of megafauna as a result of human activity. but that's not the same as the entire ecosystem being threatened with collapse, which is what is happening now. the key to the sustainability of that system was the limitation of human numbers. hunter-gathering just doesn't permit a large enough human population to destabilise the entire system.

there is absolutely no reason why humans cannot create a sustainable system that involves eating meat. what would make it sustainable are these two things:

1. strictly enforced limits to overall population and consumption.
2. 100% recycling of waste products and 0% dependence on non-renewable resources.

note that there is no ""veganism"" on this list.

what veganism would do, in *both* an optimally sustainable system *and* in our unsustainable system, is to increase the capacity of the system for human population. if everybody in the world today became a vegan the world would be not one millimetre closer to sustainability.  similarly, if everybody living in a system meeting the two requirements above was a meat eater, but the limits were set accordingly, then it would not be one millimetre further away from sustainability.

1,"i went vegan for sustainability, it wasn't very difficult i think the biggest cost is protein powder if you lift, i spend maybe $6 a day on it, but i should be spending about $8 for bigger gains. if you don't lift, you won't need to spend more than $2-3. 

i spend .50 on half an avocado a day, less than a dollar a day on supplements (the most expensive is algae oil, if you're on a budget i would just recommend fish oil instead), a dollar on almonds, then maybe $2-3 on rice/beans/quinoa. sometimes i'll spend about $1.50 - 2 on seitan. i am losing some weight, though, so i'll probably up my calorie content a little when i lose my excess. as it stands, that comes out to around $14 a day for a high protein diet, and $9 a day for a moderate protein diet.

the biggest loss is convenience. most restaurants don't really offer vegan options. i don't miss the taste of meat that much, though.

1,"low carbon employment in canada? hi,

i've got a lot of stress in my life right now... really never been so close to the street with a parent in the hospital with only a small chance they'll be leaving upright. i've also developed some ptsd from things that i've seen on dives in the ocean, but suffered a barotrauma that's ended my ability to dive. i've been riding out the pandemic working on sustainable industry but can't find any funding or don't meet the criteria to get my ideas funded, and, because i've been living with someone that's immunocompromised, i have been keeping my distance from people. i desperately want to get back to work but i can't be a part of this problem anymore. after seeing what i have, i can't justify my comfort at that price and would rather starve than be generating wealth by burning fossil carbon, which appears to be still the only way to generate wealth. the ocean was my first love and the one thing i let my guard down enough to love completely, only to dive into a patch of dead water on multiple coasts and now the idea of contributing to that imbalance/crime makes me physically ill. 

i would like to get into refrigerant/f-gas destruction or something similarly carbon negative so i can sleep at night, or work with any ngo focused on feeding the world or finding creative ways to deal with emerging problems. 

as much as i want to just walk in and get paid and forget about all this stuff, something inside me is screaming ""this is all wrong! you know it's wrong! you're killing everything, you hypocrite!"" and i can't shut it up. i also can't understand how people are bringing children into this world even though i would have loved to have been a father... but especially, how can you bring kids into this world and not care about the climate? doesn't that ensure that your kid(s) will end up hating you for bringing them into a world on fire without a plan or even minimal effort?

is there a place for people like me in this world? i really figured that the pandemic, the hurricanes, the fires, the drought, the food insecurity, etc ad infinitum would have led to some cultural awareness that the way we've been living is the problem we're trying to solve and that we'd be working together on figuring that problem out by now. instead, it seems like we can't wait to get back to making everything worse and i just can't be a part of it. i want to go back to when i didn't know how bad it was, but now that i do, all i see are people gambling on the titanic right before it hits the iceberg. what does wealth even matter when the world is on fire? are we seriously going to pass up the opportunity to work together in order to take turns starving to death to ""protect"" our own? there isn't enough left for conflict. there's barely enough left for survival. why are we still following money when it has led us here without a life raft or alternative?

i'd work for food and shelter if we were working on something bigger, together. i don't want things, but i do need people in my life and i'm worried that i'm going to collapse entirely if i don't have a direction when the bad news comes in. i went from having a home and a community to being entirely isolated and in debt since 2019 and i feel completely broken. all i'm missing is a community of like-minded people trying to figure out how to live with this world rather than against it. i think model communities are a good way to help solve these problems before we get smacked over the head by them and i can't be alone in thinking that way.

anyways, i have a background in biochemistry and medical lab science and some coding, especially embedded stuff. i'm good at growing mushrooms and other cultured foods... i'm really just looking for some new friends that don't think i'm crazy for spending as little money as possible in an oil/consumption based economy. hell, i'd run a hostel at this point, even though the colonialism part of it makes me really uncomfortable. 

i dont understand any part of my world anymore or anyone in it and i'm ready to move on into something i don't need to hate myself for being a part of.

a mega trend that the economist magazine has been pointing out for several issues recently is the rampant green washing in ""esg"" funds. assets managers are getting creepy  about taking millenial's money eager to invest in sustainable (green) companies. they finally have something a robo-index can't do better (for now). this green investment demand is essentially incentivizing companies like altria to hire the big four accounting firms of the world to assure or write fancy susty reports every year that the rating agencies eat up and give them a nice 'a+'. the idiot assets managers see that 'a+' and assume they are green, compare that against income statements, then reallocate. you see the problem here? companies can show they are green, but not actually be green within the conventional theory of sustainability. a cycle that will just continue a drift to low performance. 
so, my questions are:
-what do you all think of this trend?
-what public companies are actually green, or actually trying?
-can sustainability actually be a practical investment thesis at this point, when not even the technology or business models have transitioned?",-0.4143

1,"what is sustainability? a short explanation (work-in-progress) hey there /r/sustainability. i've noticed that there are plenty of people confused about the meaning of sustainable, so i am working on a (somewhat short) explanation that will get the idea across. comments and criticisms welcome. this is what i have so far:

sustainability means that the situation is not terminal. 

or in mathematical terms:

## use <= replacement rate

if the situation involves materials that are being used at a higher rate than they are replaced, then that situation is not sustainable.

if in the area i inhabit, 5 trees reach maturity each year, and i take less than 5 trees, then the situation is sustainable. the forest will, assuming no changes in conditions, grow or stay the same. 

if i were to take more than 5 trees per year, i would slowly but surely cut down the whole forest and the forest would become less productive as it is reduced. this situation would be unsustainable.

changes in conditions factor in as well, if someone else moves in that wants to use the forests wood as well our use may grow over the replacement rate, transforming the situation from sustainable to not.

when we talk about sustainability, the conditions must be laid out.

## in what area? 

sustainability is a **localized** measure, if you are dependent on outside resources, then changes in outside conditions that you are unable to influence can cause your situation to become unsustainable. you could measure this at any scale, if you look at the way humans are acting on earth as a whole, the situation is entirely unsustainable, we are using the planet faster than it is being replaced. however, there may be areas where the situation is sustainable, despite being unsustainable on the whole. high resolution - smaller pieces - is a better way to judge a situation than lumping it all together (though, as the parts become sustainable, we will be moving towards a situation where we the whole is as well)

## for what size population?

each place has its own **carrying capacity** - and we must include in this calculation the needs of the other life around us. this number is not fixed, it can increase or decrease based on environmental factors -  a square mile of city can support less life than a square mile of tropical rainforest. 

all that said, it basically comes down to what i started with, for a situation to be called sustainable ***must*** mean it isn't terminal - it can be sustained under current conditions.",0.9538

👉 soon manufacturers may be required to provide spare parts & instructions on how to fix their products to consumers

👉 how cool would it be if you could fix your mobile screen at home your self, or even change the processor with relative ease to upgrade your laptop of phone without having to buy a new one 

👉 planned obsolescence is a huge global issue & if forward looking governments have their way companies may need to redesign products for “continuous reuse” through repair & upgrade

i know there are many threads similar to this but in hours of getting lost in the comments, i haven't quite found anything relevant so here we go...

background: 29 years old with a bs in mechanical engineering. looking to find new career/path in sustainable/regenerative architecture and design. 

for years, i have been interested in design/build firms that have a focus on sustainability and incorporate green materials/systems. i am completely okay with going back to school to pursue a masters in some field associated with this practice but i am at a bit of a loss as to how to narrow down the program. architecture fascinates me, but i have not found a program that incorporates the hands-on building and green system aspects. this leaves me torn between looking into programs that are specific to either architecture, sustainable design, or civil engineering.

1,"paper bags and plastic tubs... hi all, hope this is the right subreddit to post this.

i was wondering, why are more supermarkets (or any new ones) not transitioning to using paper bags and plastic, reusable tubs?

i imagine a place where everything is in bulk. dry goods like pasta and rice can be siphoned out in set quantities (500g, 1kg, etc) into tubs/jars you can either bring with you or buy in store. you can also buy recyclable paper bags which themselves are made from recycled paper. you can use these for fruits, veggies, cakes, bread, whatever. even meat is presented in large trays and you pick as much as you want.

staff would be focussed on helping customers find what they need, or maybe handing out required amounts of meat or other goods for hygiene reasons. 

there would be a few tills but it would mostly be self-service, with scannable codes on screens around the store. so if you get 1kg of rice, the 1kg code would appear and you can scan it.

the major obstacles i can see are consumer laziness, set up cost and running costs.

with traditional supermarkets still selling mostly packaged goods, likely cheaper, anyone not bothered about sustainability would just go there. anyone trying the new store might be put off by the amount of preparation involved; unless you wanted to spend and fortune on tubs every time you shop, you'd need to plan your shop more precisely.

the tech required to make the self-service work mostly already exists and is in use by most major supermarkets but you'd essentially need to build a completely different store and develop the tech for managing the output of goods. while i don't think this would need to be too complicated, it would likely be expensive to start with.

running a regular supermarket has overheads of course but with shops like aldi slashing them by having goods delivered on shelf-ready pallets, our new store would have an overhead issue. how would employees get 50kg of rice into a massive bin, ready to be released in portions? they may need extra training on how to use forklifts or other machines and handling heavy goods brings with it more regulations like hazard pay.

thoughts? i'm in the uk by the way so my perspective on supermarkets comes from there.",0.8602

there's a huge opportunity to work *within* the system that we have to create a whole new landscape of offerings that help us achieve our sustainability goals. these new offerings should be superior to what's currently polluting so that consumers make the switch easily.  


we can use the power of consumer demand and pure creativity to create a sustainable world.  


1. in a creative/discussion group, we can **decide on what industries and offerings to strategically target**. this could be transportation, food... or anything else. we'll put them on our list of unsustainable products to compete against.
2. we can then create campaigns to fund explorations and research into how to make these products more sustainable, and also superior. we can create crowdfunding campaigns to **fund tests and minimum viable sustainable products**.
3. once something is seen as viable we can **put it up for investment**. we, ourselves, can invest in it while attracting outside investors to expand the products and services if necessary. essentially, profit wouldn't be the enemy in this case, it would be a nice byproduct of creating a sustainable world.

the cool thing? there's no need to quit your day job if you don't want to. even with regular people participating in something like these we can spread the word and make progress.

another cool thing is that we don't have to go through the arduous process of overthrowing capitalism before we start achieving sustainability. we can work within the system to transform the world by replacing outdated industries.   


this is an actionable plan that could get us on track. if interested send me a pm and i'll see how we can all connect.",0.9951

how might we turn this recent exxon ruling (and a company being held to account for something other than profits) into an epic opportunity to achieve sustainability? here’s how we might do it by sparking a “startup renaissance.”  

i (like many) have been thinking deeply about sustainability for almost a decade now. the not-so-obvious and glorious conclusion that i’ve arrived at is that we need a “startup renaissance” where we create startups to replace everything that is unsustainable.

here’s why. the real problem is that everything that we’ve *built* over the centuries was not built with sustainability in mind. that’s a problem, but that’s also fixable. 

when we look out on the world, the things we’ve developed (technology, tools, processes, businesses, infrastructure) are generating the negative and unsustainable consequences. these are all things that we can change at *will.* 

how? we would want to create seed concepts that we can test and fund starting immediately through investments and crowdfunding. essentially we can crowdsource a whole new society from the ground up, and actually probably become prosperous from it as a whole. by providing a wave of new investments, the investors can divest from their unsustainable companies and regular people can invest in whole new companies and features for the society. 

at that point, everything becomes something we can change. it’s an opportunity to address all major problems at once and create a sustainable world for good. 

is it instantaneous? no, but we can easily start small. this is an actionable plan versus the non-solutions that are currently prescribed for sustainability for which we have no real plan of action. 

what does exxon have to do with this? well, for the first time a corporation is being forced to be accountable for their impacts by changing how the company operates. this is big. other companies will see this and know their time being destructive for profit is coming to an end. they’ll want to look for lower risk companies, and this “startup renaissance” can be the answer to that. 

also, destructive companies will likely enjoy the idea of this kind of democratization of the changes that need to be made. it won’t be only on them to make these changes that are impossible for any single company to make on their own. basically, we can all work together to make the necessary changes and actually have profit not be a problem in the equation. 

if you’re into startups and sustainability i’d love to simply chat about this as a possibility. please feel free to reach out.",0.9536

i recently applied to be a ""sustainability outreach coordinator"" for a small university town.

even more recently they informed me that they received a lot of great applications from a lot of great candidates this year - but mine wasn't top tier.. and they would be moving forward without me.

well, hopefully whoever gets in there does a great job and everyone likes them, and they help the town and go on to save the world.

anyway, i know this isn't the perfect pitch - but i'm still thinking its a good idea -

&#x200b;

while i was researching / preparing - i went ahead and made a google drive to organize all the city projects and programs by category

 \+ links to city resource pages + links to participating organizations + links to similar projects in other cities - regional / state / tri-state / national..

and the same for the university ""sustainability"" projects + ""sustainability"" majors & faculty + sustainability groups + similar projects at other campuses.

&#x200b;

it could be helpful if more cities / climate councils / organizations / community groups / mutual aid groups.. made similar drives to organize projects and links, and links to peers - for their category of interest and/or campus / city / state / tri-state / national / global projects and participating organizations.

even better if they shared with their peers, even better if they shared with everyone, even better if this lead to collaboration and coordination - including standard drives at every level - and working-groups to develop ultimate collaboration / coordination platform /networks.

but google drive isn't all that great for discussion.

&#x200b;

a lot of people are out there wanting to help good things get done - maybe getting some links on reddit or facebook and getting into arguments- but not knowing other parallel projects or local / regional / state projects, programs, or organizations.. or dis-satisfied with current options / membership commitments / cultures..

and a lot of people, and groups, and organizations, and cities, and states - don't know about good projects and programs going on around them or good management platforms- apparently.

better municipal organizational platforms would help, better cooperative networks would help.

&#x200b;

does your campus or city or organization or group have a good forum and platform to organize all the  local and regional eco-social sustainability / resilience / mutual aid / social ecology-esque...

projects and programs and groups and teams and organizations and shops and gardens and people who care about aquaponics and sustainable investing and..

to better discuss and peer-review and demonstrate and coordinate and collaborate and help eachother with projects and programs locally, regionally, nationally,

and / or by category and / or just for a specific category ?

if you are using an amazing coordination platform or forum, please share links below.

&#x200b;

i've found there are some good organization / coordination / peer review / collaboration platforms and forums out there. but there are a lot of cities and organizations that aren't using them, and very few host multiple cities or organizations in a cooperative network, and very few are open to the public to see planning / discussion.

some are only made for one city, some are only made for one category of project..

&#x200b;

but most everything would be easier and better if more cities and organizations and groups were using better cooperative organizational platforms - even better if they were using the best - even better if more cities and organizations (and political parties) and groups and campuses and college majors.. were using the same one in cooperative networks.

&#x200b;

how to get there - a ""sustainability / resilience"" municipal syndicalist platform and network for everyone?

&#x200b;

rather than everyone trying to join existing platforms or organizations, or copying something that is isn't used by their neighbors..

it would probably be beneficial for all (or most) of the organizations in roughly the same category - food systems, housing / urban design, economics / finance, mutual aid / sharing, campus.. etc. to get together with their peers at the city, county, regional, state /province level to use existing platforms to form groups to discuss projects and programs..

and also compare platforms and networks..

even better if the heavy-hitters can form a 'sustainability/ resilience municipal platform network' working-group-  to develop a better platform and network for everyone - and compare and test and de-bug and help spread.

the same way aquaponics supporters and projects, etc. should group up and peer-review.

&#x200b;

if you know anyone in a sustainable management or coordinator or organizer or platform developer position, feel free to suggest they use their amazing platform to start a group and get together with their peers.

but i still expect that might take a while.

1. or reddit sub, or facebook group, or slack, or whatever else people are using / comfortable with - probably good to have these anyway, to reach and help more people.
2. but a few people / organizations will check back and forth with the main city / campus discord / drive to check and post updates, project links, answer questions, coordinate..

\- how great to be able to see something similar for projects and groups in other campuses and cities in your region  - see the projects and discussion, and be able to bring links to good projects back to your city and working groups- even better if there are discords (and drives) at the regional / state / tri-state / national levels - reviewing, discussing, comparing projects / coordinating / collaborating..

1. my little town is only going to have a few people interested in any category, fewer participating in each group, fewer in each working-group, fewer committed to projects.. but other cities might have something going that we can see and copy, or help with, or have a development team,
   1. if not other cities, then a working group at the regional or state level or tri-state level might make sense.
2. it might be worthwhile to go ahead and start and fill out the groups for a sustainability discord for other campuses and cities,
3. and regional / state / tri-state / national  groups and discords- generally - and for categories / projects / groups at each level
4. and maybe go ahead and start sustainability project coordination discords for other regions / states / categories to get them going, and post links on the bigger groups we're sharing around.

&#x200b;

\- so we could fairly easily make similar discords for all ""sociology majors for sustainability"", ""media makers for sustainability"", ""cyclists"" for sustainability, ""investors for sustainability"", ""restaurant owners for sustainability"", ""foodies for sustainability"", ""sustainable food systems"", ""urban design / housing / landscaping / water ""  at the county, regional, state / province / tri-state.. etc. levels.

\+ working groups for projects and proposals

1. including crowdfunding / investing platform / portfolios
2. education / training / media groups
3. working groups for ""ultimate forum / platform / network ""
4. easier for organizations / cities / coordinators / media makers / educators... to see and study and help and reach and coordinate their target audience.
5. virtual 
   1. virtual models of projects for demonstration / peer-review / training, and proposals / crowdfunding, and city resource / project / operations management / coordination will be tremendous - 
   2. how to keep track of all the groups in the virtual worlds? how to keep all the various virtual groups and worlds connected and collaborating? - an amazing universal platform will be nice, a series of discords will be fine if we still don't have anything else.",0.9998
1,"best environmental plastic material for soft plastics? hi, this is my first post here, and i'm very interested in researching the most suitable bioplastics that is able to be implemented on soft plastics especially plastic films for food. 

as i understand that we should be reducing the use of single use plastics, but some of those have very critical functions that we cannot eliminate them (food wrappers, medical supplies, delivery packages, etc.)

right now, i'm very heavily into using seaweed as an alternative form of bioplastics, as companies such as notpla and evoware have started to commercialise them to minimise the environmental impact. i feel like we need more of these companies working together to make the world a more environmental friendly place to live in.

my main question will be if seaweed is one of the top materials to be used for soft plastics? if so, is it potentially scalable to make it cost competitive compared to current soft plastics? if not, is there any other alternatives that i can read more about for comparison? would appreciate any great opinions from you guys about this, or if this question has been posted here before that i'm not aware of. thanks!",0.9673

1,"a mental roadmap that explains how we can make sustainability a reality through collective action. some (or even many) say it’s impossible — mass collaboration. they cite that “humans have never collaborated in human history.” but, consider questioning those assumptions. first of all... collaboration is kind of our thing as humans, and it’s likely **required** right now on a mass scale to achieve sustainability and end critical world problems. just because we haven’t done it before doesn’t mean that it’s impossible. 

it might be a big leap in thought for many here, but just know that i’ve thought about this for like... 10 years, and i’m pretty thoroughly convinced that mass collaboration is possible and really smart as an idea to try out. 

your first question might be — “why?”

why do we need to collaborate to achieve sustainability and solve critical world problems? the answer is that we can likely only achieve sustainability through this kind of effort. 

if you will, travel down this epiphany chain with me.

the first time i “woke up” was in chemistry 101. the instructor woefully told us about our climate problems... and this was before it was trending as a topic. all of the scientific information that i had taken in up to this point suddenly made sense... of course we have climate sustainability problems! we haven’t *ever* set out to make our world sustainable as humans, so why would it be? achieving a sustainable climate became the most important thing in my life. how could it not be? it’s critical for our survival!

but the problem seemed so... big. the magnitude was huge to me. climate change appeared to me as an existential threat that was *interlaced* with every other facet of our society. there was no way we could solve it without changing **all parts** of how our world works. it’s our technology and industry and infrastructure that creates these emissions... and that’s the whole dang world! 

it became clear to me that a massive change and a massive problem-solving effort was necessary. 

it was so striking to think this. there’s actually **no way to solve climate change as if it were a problem existing in isolation.** we essentially would have to transform our society all at once to solve it. could this even be possible? 

that idea was so much different than what’s going on now. right now, we have the max being a few governments working together on a few initiatives. either that or collaborations between the un and other agencies. but, this wasn’t close to what i saw/see as necessary if we wanted to transform the whole human world. we needed nearly everyone. 

sustainability is an “all hands on deck” problem. everyone with the capacity to care needs to be in on solution-creation... and that’s what i see in one sense... but the key that was and *still* is missing is **mass** collaboration. 

what does that mean? get this. it’s going to take all of those individual organizations, people, governments, **in coordination** and working collectively.  like one central coordinated effort type thing. why? 

what might it take to transform a society? how might we possibly manage that? 

i’ll tell you. the secrets are collaboration / crowdsourcing or crowdfunding.

collaboration could be used to create the vision of what our society could look like, and crowdfunding could be used to pay for the changes to be realized. will it happen all at once? no. but we can enter into mass collaboration by starting to envision our new world and use that as a basis to start crafting new components to our society and getting the individual parts funded. 

have i taken you too far? 

what part is impossible? 

the important part is that we start now and test out our big ideas. once we have the vision set (a sustainable, justice, awesome world) and we start building toward that with experiments, then we’ll be able to see **what works for us** and what doesn’t. enough theoretical arguments about what’s most sustainable.. let’s try out all ideas through crowdsourcing efforts and see those ideas in action. we’ll be able to see what deserves our attention and investment. 

is it a huge operation? sure, but it starts small and we can bring in the smart people to help us coordinate this. it’s not impossible. 

the cool parts about it? it’s something we can start now without needing government buy-in or permission. we simply start crowdsourcing. it also means that we get to write the rules of the future. do we want ubi so people won’t be stuck to their current jobs and we can get rid of unsustainable ones? we can make that happen? do we want parties every day? we can make that a “thing” because we’d be working together to make it happen. 

yes, i’m proposing that we activate *everyone* in this mass collaborative effort to transform the world to be sustainable and awesome. is it a moonshot? yes. but what other solutions seem viable when you actually think them through?

our current problem is that we have no clear path to implementing and scaling any of our proposed solutions for sustainability... i mean. people propose end points like “no plastic,” but rarely do they every suggest how we’ll actually get there. 

this solution that is proposed here is the “how” for any big solution that needs to be implemented. 

i’m interested in writing a guide for exactly how we might do this, and any questions that you have will help me know what questions to answer. please, ask away!

comments like “that’s impossible” aren’t helpful, but giving a concrete example of why it might not be impossible could be helpful. even better is to ask “how might we ________?”

1,"impossible packaging decision alright, so i have to make what is essentially an impossible packaging decision for my company, and i was hoping this community may be of help. i’ll lead by saying that my company cares about science, so we aren’t on a mission to only use x or never use y. we’ll do what science indicates is ideal. 

so here is the struggle: we produce clothing. we make sustainable performance apparel from primarily natural fibers. we’re meticulous about the environmental impact of our production. now, we care about our packaging. we want to do away with plastic if possible, but it presents a lot of issues. companies like patagonia have kept plastic polymailers in their distribution because the goods need to be protected. above all, the garments have to be kept safe, since they have a far greater environmental impact than the packaging. 

plastic is amazing. it’s waterproof, it has low ghg emissions compared to paper, and it is theoretically recyclable. however, plastic packaging essentially isn’t recycled here in the us. the goods are shipped around the world, so the layer next to the garments needs to be waterproof and abrasion resistant. plastic makes sense here. however, we’ve been looking at pla/pbat blend bio-plastic home compostable bags to replace that layer. they’re still waterproof, and they can be composted and they degrade in marine environments (as far as we can tell). the problem is they’re single use, not recyclable, virgin, and likely won’t be composted, since most people in the us do not compost. so our option is glassine (paper) next to the product, but that won’t protect it/plastic next to the product, but it’s plastic and not really recyclable/or bioplastic next to the product, but it will probably go to landfill and not break down in that environment.

then there’s the outer mailer itself. this can be plastic, bioplastic, or paper as well. paper doesn’t protect as well,  and it has much higher ghg emissions up front and if composted. as for plastic and bioplastic, you get the gist. most people in the us have access to paper recycling, so it seems like a win. but recycling is so energy and water intensive, plus the ghg cost upfront, that we get stuck in this cycle of impossible decisions. 

any suggestions or resources out there? we would be incredibly grateful. i’m trying to become a resources for other companies in my field as well, so it could to a long way.

1,"our small individual actions collectively have impact bigger that we can imagine ... we can put it to use only if we pledge to ourselves to take that action “the past couple of decades, governments and large corporations have not managed to significantly change their behaviors, for numerous acceptable or 
unacceptable reasons. if corporations and governments continue on the same path of environment and sustainability inaction, 
there is little change we can expect in the near future. perhaps this narrative may change in the long run, as organizations start to see the impact of environmental inaction on their balance sheets.
hypothetically, if five million regular single-use water bottle consumers decide to stop consuming one single-use water bottle a day and switch to reusable water bottles, that is nearly two billion fewer water bottles consumed in one year. that magnitude of change will bring about a big enough financial impact on the bottled water industry to either produce fewer single-use water bottles the following year or find environmentally palatable consumption alternatives.”

1,"my theory on why consumption is inherently unsustainable and how to fix it. try poking holes in it. the good place hit the nail on the head when explaining why being good is becoming increasingly difficult. we can no longer handpick flowers and walk them to our grandma. now, we order flowers (\*\*grown with pesticides\*\*) from a phone (\*\*made in a sweatshop\*\*) and delivered from thousands of miles away (\*\*carbon footprint\*\*). \[see below for their full rundown\]

\_\_\_

anywho, i've been studying the economics of our consumption recently and came across an economics theory called 'the theory of externalities"". an externality is an impact on a third party that had nothing to do with the production or consumption of a product. in the case mentioned above, the third parties would be the people who deal with degrading soil from pesticides, the sweatshop workers and their poor treatment, and society as a whole from the effects of climate change.

externalities are supposed to be mitigated through pigouvian taxes (similar to a carbon tax or a tobacco tax), but companies always find ways to avoid them...whether it's through political pressure, or simply proving it hard to put a cost on an impact to someone else (how do you price the tax of poor soil quality to a nearby town?).

to me, it seems like there are two solutions, either we start voting in politicians who support policy we believe it (which we've all seen how successful this play is)...or we pay for the externalities produced by \*\*our consumption\*\*. what if when you bought the pesticide-ridden flowers, you also donated to an organization researching organic pesticides. what if when you bought those flowers on a sweatshop-produced cell phone, you also donated to an organization certifying the working conditions at phone manufacturers?

by definition, sustainability is the capacity to endure. if we are all mitigating the unintended consequences of the things we buy, wouldn't that make the system fundamentally more sustainable?

1,"should c02 emission the only indicator of sustainability? the less exciting part of sustainability?

the part that asks about accountability and responsibility.

did you know that according to a report by the bureau for the appraisal of societal impacts for citizen information **(coffee, behind the success story, 2018)**, in peru and ethiopia, each dollar linked to coffee exports in 2017 generated between 85 and 90 cents of hidden costs at the expense of these countries and their populations (the “societal costs”)?

**so what is societal cost?**  
**societal cost (according to k. w. kapp, 1963).**  
all direct and indirect, present and future losses and expenditure that are borne by third parties or the community as a whole due to the social, health and environmental impacts of production and consumption methods.

**according to the bureau for the appraisal of societal impacts for citizen information, societal cost can be divided into 3 categories:**

1. the first component concerns producers’ inability to earn enough income to permit them — and their family — to live in dignity.
2. the second component of societal cost concerns local government spending on ensuring essential public services (education, healthcare, social affairs, water/electricity, transportation, justice, support for agriculture and environmental protection).
3. the final component of societal costs concerns the emission of greenhouse gases all along the chain, from the grower to the final consumer.

**to at least alleviate these challenges, the proposal is:**

1. demand a living income for farming communities in developing countries.
2. climate change may further marginalise more impoverished producers, as farmers with good access to capital and technology are more likely to manage emerging climate risk.  
so the private sector initiatives should share the costs and risks of climate-smart programs.
3. lack of transparency around pricing is supported by antitrust laws that protect companies against sharing price information, translating into brands telling sustainability stories without an economic element. consequently, consumer trust in brand stories around farming is distorted as consumers already believe they support farmers’ livelihood, which translates into less willingness to pay more and lower demand for change from the consumer side (sca, 2019). hence, demanding full sustainability around pricing is paramount.

we need a framework for sustainability that seeks innovations beyond environmental practices that focus on energy, water, natural resources, pollution and waste management **into** social-economic inclusion.

stand with us if you too believe that a full-time coffee farmer should be able to make a living income from their farm revenue.

(it’s an every morning fight) i put on some documentaries on television while we are all together, to show how it kills the ocean. but they don’t seem to care. they just don’t take it seriously. it feels that they are not interested in the topic at all. the thing behind this is that the vendors we buy this stuff from don’t know what’s a non plastic bag and there’s no banning of plastic here or anything. and so it lands up on my kitchen counters everyday. it’s bothering the hell out of me. 
i am currently on the tread of working on my own e-commerce store which is built upon sustainability. maybe this will in-still some kind of care for the environment in my parents. but meanwhile i build that, these habits are bothering the hell out of me honestly. if someone faces an equally annoying issue or has faced or has any suggestions, really appreciate it.",-0.9298

i'm currently at a point of change in my life where i want a total career change. and currently i work as a designer in construction which i know is a big polluting industry, and not something i really want to be a part of because as much as i might try, i can't really change it from where i am, clients don't wanna hear about a more expensive solution for their building that reduces carbon footprint :(.

sounds like a double-edged sword to me. what's more is that many people in developing countries don't even know what ""sustainability"" is. it's basically just a buzz word to them. they're more concerned with increasing wealth and consumption, because clearly that's the only way to become a developed country. what do you think about this? i'm asking because (1) i live in a developing country myself and (2) most of the sustainability subs i find in reddit are focused on developed countries or the west. i struggle to find a discussion about this aspect of sustainability, specifically on developing countries.",0.9735

it's taken a while to go through things bit by bit and i'm at a point where there are 5+ year old boxes of food, cosmetics and cleansers and whatnot that are unopened or only partially used and way past the use by date, and i'm at a loss for how to sustainably dispose of it.

regarding the cosmetic products, some have liquids in the plastic containers and i'm not sure if it's better to flush out the liquid (cleanser, lotions, etc.) down the drain (affecting the water and pipes) and recycle the plastic bottle it came in or just throw away the whole container without thinking about it.

same with some of the food products - sometimes the carton is cardboard but the food product inside is packaged in plastic. do i take it out of the cardboard, cut open the plastic packaging and dump the food then go from there?

i've been having a bit of a weird one recently. it dawned on me the other week that the line i was drawing between humans and animals was arbritrary, and the ethical diet to have was vegan. this took me down a rabbit hole, but i've found that there are many concerns about veganic agriculture as well. slavery on farms, unsustainable for soil, long shipments across the world, etc. it seems like everywhere i step, i contribute to suffering. i think one of the most important things i should consider, is that my food comes from the uk, where i live. also, if i can confirm the animal didn't suffer in its life, eat local meat over soy from far away. not wasting food is a big must as well. is this about the closest i can get to an ethical diet? does anyone know of any tools i can use to make sure my food is from the uk/doesn't involve animal suffering? i imagine no matter what i do, i contribute to some suffering, but i want to minimise it as much as possible.

it just feels like going vegan and eating any old thing that's been farmed halfway across the world, feels like a cop out. for background info, i don't have the means to live on a permaculture farm or anything like that. i'm a young, healthy, city dweller, with no dietary requirements beyond the normal.

1,"looking for a truly global view on sustainability i think sustainability is viewed very differently in developing countries. whereas in countries like the us where overconsumption is becoming a big problem, in countries like the philippines we need to consume more and more in order to prosper as an economy. i remember documentaries like seaspiracy saying that not eating fish can save the planet. i agree on that statement, i really do. but the thing is, many developing countries, particularly in coastal communities, rely on fish to make a living and feed their families. what do you think about this?

in terms of climate crisis, there's also a very stark difference. developed countries are starting to invest heavily on renewable energies, whereas many developing countries still have to rely on the usual non-renewable sources in order to accelerate economic growth. the current pace of renewable energies, i think, is not yet enough to aid in the growth of developing countries.

meanwhile, developed countries are better positioned to not take current responsibility for the climate crisis because their days of rapid industrialization are long gone. developed countries are so 'developed' that they have the capacity to quickly shift to new, sustainable technologies. developing countries, however, are just beginning to industrialize and without doing so, we wouldn't progress (e.g., china). so it's hard to place accountability on who or what should really be responsible for climate change. 

the way i see it, there really has to be some kind of change in the world order. a mindset that focuses on economic growth not based upon endless growth, but one that's based on a communion with nature and the planet. through this mindset, a lot of the old and antiquated systems that we have will be forced to change for the betterment of the common good. there also has to be some kind of technology and knowledge exchange between countries that'll allow this to happen. 

do you think this is something possible in a few decades' time, while the clock's already ticking fast for our planet? couple that with many ongoing geopolitical issues and i can't help but feel overwhelmed and hopeless sometimes.",0.8393

for example if people repurposed electric motors from failed electrical appliances such as a washing machine, it can be easily turned into a small scale generator to *assist* powering a home. obviously i know the wind wouldn't always blow the sun doesnt always shine etc. but if suddenly half of all homes had 10% of their power generated from an old appliance thats at the ""end of its useful life"" and suddenly we can get another maybe 5 years of low efficiency power without making new generators etc?

1,"need help on becoming more sustainable heya fellow creatures, im an 18-year-old high school student and id like some help on becoming more sustainable in my household. i've only recently become more woke to climate issues over the past months, so here are the specs:
▫️ 4 bdrm house + 2 baths + 2 living rooms, all appliances are gas powered (water, heating, cooking stove, ovens, fossil fuel grid powered) bc our house is definately not up to date with modern appliances. recently as its been warming up here (us, okla), we've switched on our ac, but our house is poorly insulated and the ac unit is old; therefore we always keep it on in order for there to be a comfortable temperature  :(, 
▫️we have 7 people in our household right now, which means we need to consume more electricity, gas, food and water
▫️ i'm personally willing to go vegan for sustainability purposes (haven't committed myself yet), but my family doesn't want to cut out meat (we eat meat most days, we'll have maybe 1 or 2 days per week where we dont use beef). we use animal products almost every day
▫️personally, my car is a 2006 ford mustang, so it drinks up gas like crazy. recently, i never use the ac or heating in my car unless absolutely necessary, and i keep the thermostat set to heat to make it easier on my engine and gas mileage. i can't substitute my driving for public transportation, unfortunately, due to my local town's infrastrucutre and my siblings depend on my driving.
▫️i admit that i use single-use packaged food a lot because i don't have a lunch period at school.

with all this on the table, these are the problems that are bigger to tackle in my household. i'd like some advice on how i could cut down me and my family's carbon footprint, so if you savvy dudes could give me some advice, i'd be very grateful. thanks!",0.971

1,"getting to 95% since the pandemic started a lot of my multi-use items have gotten replaced with disposable plastic at the producers end. things like bulk bins at grocery stores or places that i would usually go for lunch that had sustainable options now loading you up with plastic forks and such... it makes me sick.

i used to beat myself up that i wasn't at 100% sustainability. my partner kept and keeps reminding me that most people aren't even putting in 95% effort and that i can make a bigger difference moving other folks from the ~50% mark to the 95% than trying to get myself to 100%.

 i would call myself an environmentally considerate person. i am blessed to live in a city where i can bike almost anywhere from my home instead of driving, i try not to use any products that don't degrade when washed down the sink, try to avoid plastics as much as possible, eat a vegetarian diet with limited eggs and cheese (they come from my friends farm!), buy local produce, etc, etc.

but it feels like so many things are turning the opposite direction. 

i guess what i'm trying to get to is: 

1) what are your 5% cheat things and why do you let yourself do them? (ie. finding vegan cheese around here is full of plastic, where as the cheese from the local cow farm near me has a much more reasonable amount of plastic. i would buy the vegan cheeses more often if they had more sustainable packaging)

2) how do we get other people to the ""95%"" mark? (for example, a friend of mine only drinks carbonated bottled water, but there's so much plastic, transportation cost and then the recycling infrastructure where i live is non-existent. how do i get this person to care about what they're doing to this fragile earth, our collective home)",0.9217

1,"to the parents or against having no children for the sake of reducing emissions recently, i've stumbled across something i can only describe as dangerous within the green/sustainability movement. its the idea that you should have less children since each person causes x amount of emissions. ignoring the fact that this is more or less the less physically violent version of the ecofascist idea of killing ""less valueable"" people to reduce emissions since it doesn't demand directly inflicting harm on living indivduals, on top of ignoring that the emissions a person causes aren't fixed values, instead changing based on technological advancement and lifestyle, it also works entirely in the wrong direction. this idea is based on the image that the number of people is the problem and ignores the fact that the individual is hardly responsible for the ecological apocalypse we see looming on the horizon. the issue is instead almost entirely to blame on the production side of things, from what is produced, how, how it is marketed, where the raw materials are procured from, for which purpose it is produced (human need vs profit) all the way down to how it gets to us. the only way to really affect this side is by fighting on the political level, for regulations, for change in the political and economic system, for more political power in the hands of the people who have to suffer the majority of its effects. in this situation, where it a political struggle against those who seek only their own gain, ignoring the impact of their endless greed for greater profit, having less of us or even eventually dying out is the biggest issue we could have. so no, definitely don't have less children if your reason for being reluctant is how their impact might hasten climate change. instead, make sure you raise them to become people who can see the lies corporations try to feed us (greenwashing, corrupt studies and so on), who try to help those who are in need and who can carry the torch of trying to avoid the worst of this climate crisis. we'll need their brains to discover technologies to halt and reverse the damage of the past, their hands to build the projects we'll need to put such technologies into practice and their voices to bring about the change needed to even begin on working on them. in the midst of the now unavoidable climate crisis, the coming generations will be the ones who decide the fate of humanity. after all, if we fail, there probably won't be a habitable planet earth, much less a human species on it.",-0.9949

1,"breaking the grass ceiling: how can we shift discussions on sustainability to be about more than the environment? environmentalism often dominates sustainability discourse. the subreddit itself is a good example. you will struggle to find posts here that aren’t environmentally focused. this is despite the subreddit explicitly defining sustainability in a way that should encourage broader views incorporating a kind of “three pillars” approach that also factors in the economy and society. 

sustainability is a multidisciplinary discourse. any and every discipline out there can be applied to the questions, concerns, and observations that sustainability preoccupies itself with. in actuality, three pillars (society, economy, environment) aren’t anywhere near enough to capture the breadth of it all, but we can appreciate that three is better than one and so this isn’t a criticism of the definition of sustainability the subreddit provides. even if it’s limited, it should still encourage a broader discussion, and yet…doesn’t. 

everything is relevant or can be made relevant with the right questions and framing. economics, gender studies, astronomy, psychology, marketing, organisational management, art, history, philosophy, decolonial studies…there isn’t a discipline out there that doesn’t have something important to contribute. if it’s not clear to you how, just ask me and i’ll do my best to show you how x discipline is relevant.  

yet environmentalism dominates. ecological concerns dominate. 

i understand that issues like climate change represent ecological problems in fundamental ways, but i also passionately believe that such issues are not reducible to that alone. pick any sustainability issue from climate change to meat consumption to planetary boundaries and you will very quickly realize there are other factors that play hugely influential roles: economics, politics, culture, religion, geopolitics and security, and on the list goes. 

scholars in this space have long known this. the point that “sustainability” is more than environmentalism had been made from the very first moments the discipline became mainstream, and well before. 

yet here we are in 2021, many decades into academics making this point repeatedly, and we are still seeing sustainability dominated by the colour green, by environmental motifs (leaves, trees, and hands holding the earth are the dominant iconography), and by discussions that focus primarily if not exclusively on environmental concerns.

they always say ""we need to save the earth for future generations"". but those people aren't even born yet, they don't have feelings now at maybe they won't actually care. also it's again only a human problem that we want our future generations to have what we have. so is it actually an egoistic thing (by humans in general) to care about sustainability? is it morally ""right"" to expect people who are living right now to inconvenience themselves for future generations who aren't even alive yet and maybe never will be?",0.5768

1,"let's talk about coffee... java, joe, mud, whatever you call it, many of us start out day with a cup of it. however, coffee comes in many guises and in the post i wanted to go other some of the pros and cons of the different ways to consume coffee. i'll focus on brewing method and certifications.

i'm a researcher in food sustainability. whilst coffee isn't my specialism, i've attended seminars and had discussions with those for whom it is. hopefully that, combined with my own experience gives me some foundation.

the topic is almost endless and this can't possibly be complete guide, but hopefully i'll go over some of the main things to consider. needless to say, i'm sure you can all add millions of points to this and disagree with particular comments etc. each type of coffee consumption also has different pros and cons, not all of which are directly comparable. consequently, some of this is based on subjective judgement. 

# how you make it

**pod machines** \- coffee pod machines are now common place. their negative is obvious, the production and disposal of single use capsules. their main positive is that they use smaller amounts of coffee than any other brewing method.

regarding the pods, they can come in various guises. nespresso and other ***aluminium*** pods can be recycled endlessly, this does reduce their impact (as aluminium mining is very damaging) however, you still have that initial cost + the cost of recycling, so it by no means absolves them. ***plastic*** pods, in my view, should be avoided as they usually have an aluminium seal and with the coffee grounds still inside i'm highly sceptical about if they are truly recycled when it comes to it. you can buy ***re-usable*** capsules that you fill yourself. these can be plastic or metal. they have mixed reviews and be aware that the plastic ones have quite limited life spans. metal re-usable pods are a very good option to reduce your coffee impact. ***compostable*** pods are now available (eden project, rave coffee) which solves the waste issue. compared to aluminium, i honestly don't know how they match up, it all depends where the source material comes from. however, i opt for compostable as it has an obvious benefit on the waste, supports sustainable innovation, and businesses willing to do that are likely thinking of other things they can do.

i would especially avoid any pod machines that take specialised bespoke pods, they limit your choice and the machine has a high risk of being redundant in the near future.

**espresso machine** \- espresso machines have limited packaging waste and generally are on-par with other non-pod coffee. the main downside of espresso machines is the machine itself, which requires significant resources to manufacture. the machine also has a somewhat limited lifespan. this is the option i personally use.

**stove top** \- many of the benefits of the espresso machine, but with a far lower material input to the machine itself. a good stove-top espresso maker will also outlive you. the primary downside here is that they are not energy efficient, a lot of heat is wasted from the stove. however, if you have renewable energy powering an electric stove, this is a very desirable choice.

**drip, filter, and cafetiere** \- less common than they were, but produce large volumes of brew relative to the coffee used. so an excellent choice for families, offices, groups etc. gravity filter coffee has less machine inputs that the electric drip devices. filter papers obviously have a cost (they can be re-used a few times though). a good cafetiere can last a lifetime, so a strong choice there. clear taste limitations on all of these though.

**instant** \- a huge benefit of instant is that it requires no new equipment, assuming you already own a kettle. regarding production, it is generally considered the least impactful way to consume coffee. the downside is, of course, the taste. if you don't enjoy it, the environmental impact is absolutely not worth it.

# certification

**fairtrade** \- this certification essentially means that producers and workers are paid fairly for their work and crop and that they are generally buffered from things like price fluctuations. for me, this is a really important label to look for.

**rainforest alliance** \- this certification shares some of the aspects of fairtrade but is also focussed on maintaining the environmental status of land and waterways. another one i look out for.

**organic** \- i'll be honest, i actively avoid organic coffee. of course there are pros and cons to organic production. but within the coffee industry, the growing demand for organic has lead to increased deforestation. furthermore, organic crops have lower yields, so require more land to produce the same volume of coffee. obviously, there's a notable ghg emission with inorganic fertilisers though. it's a pretty close call on this imo.

# other considerations

**bulk-buy** \- the bigger a pack is, the less packaging it has per weight of product. obviously this only applies if you don't buy so much it spoils.

**packaging** \- keep an eye on what your coffee is packaged in. some brands (rave) offer compostable packaging, others recyclable, and others not recyclable at all. many zero waste shops also sell coffee, eliminating packaging all together.

**compost your grounds** \- coffee is high in nitrogen and a great fertiliser. use your grounds on your plants.

**take your own cup** \- we all know this and in covid times it's more tricky. but coffee cups are a huge source of waste. so if you can, take your own with you when you buy coffee out.

**second hand machines** \- machines are a huge source of the impacts, so do try and get second hand machines, or at least machines that will last well, that you'll take care of.

**the best thing you can do is to not drink coffee** \- coffee is not essential, we drink it for pleasure. if you do not drink it at all, or even skip a cup or two here and there, you're guaranteed to be reducing all impacts. of course, we are allowed to enjoy things in life, that includes coffee, it's your decision as to what you do or do not think is worth it.",0.9951

i wish to one day be a self-sustaining entity if at all possible.

it has come to my understanding that one of the many crucial necessities in pursuit of self sustainability is your source if food.

being a vegetarian-by-choice, i wish to learn about the growth, care and healthy development of all kinds plants, herbs, trees, bushes, shrubs and the various extracts possible from each of them. extracts such as fruit, vegetables, herbs, flowers etc.  

the aim is this, i wish to understand the chemical/biological composition of nutrition that the human body needs  (or at least what my body needs) on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. once a fair understanding of this is formed, i need to further my understanding of this long yet necessary list of nutrition that i'd need and one by one the various sources i can extract it from. once i have the sources figured i'd like to basically grow my own complete and balanced nutrition which i can extract from my own little farm. also i'd need a full year growing guide for different weather's as everything does not naturally grow throughout the year, yet, my need to receive a balanced and complete nutrition is constant throughout the year. hence i must be in a position that at any given time of the year, my nutrition is not compromised. 

i'd like to know where to start?

what book/article/course/source would i need to get started?

also, i've recently received plants as a parting gift. this is where my journey begins. i'd like to post them all here and have their botanical and english names written down so that i can make a care guide for each one. some have already withered and others have unfortunately dried completely(or at least looks that way to me) if i can post them here do let me know.

today, the head of profession for power (my big boss) sent the whole power team an email asking for suggestions to meet london net carbon neutrality goal (by 2030). 
his words were “at this stage, no idea is too big or too small and, for the moment at least, let’s not worry about potential barriers”

i have already little ideas like piezoelectric steps in the underground or development of hydrogen taxi fleets with central refill stations but i would gladly take any suggestions you may have. 
ideally something documented (research paper, similar successful project...) so the suggestion has more weight. 

i feel like it is a great opportunity so i really want to submit as many ideas as possible. 

thanks in advance for any help you could provide.",0.9895

so, my question is, why is making a product out of, say, cactus more sustainable than making a product out of cellulose from trees? i figure some plants must account for a greater amount of carbon capture  than others. but is this related to mass? which property of plant life helps us understand the amount of carbon absorbed?",0.7536

(x-post r/zerowaste) i'm currently reading *omnivore's delimma* by michael pollan and just finished the chapter about ""beyond organic"" foods- that is, sustainable and locally sourced meats and produce, free of pesticides and antibiotics and shit. it was really eye opening for me to read about something like that in action, and though i've been a vegetarian for almost 8 years, i often shop at fred meyer or other big grocery stores. i'm looking to start eating more locally grown and seasonal produce (and locally raised meat for my family) but it's all kind of overwhelming and i'm not sure where to begin.

i guess i'd start at a local grocery store that uses as much local supply as it can, but stuff doesn't always say where it's from, and when it does there's no guarantee it was grown sustainably. do i go full portlandia and check out these local farms for myself and maybe join a cult? i know i've been suckered in before by eggs with ""pasture raised!"" written on the box only to find out the ""pasture"" is the size of a small hallway for 1000 chickens. sorry if my question is kinda of broad and open ended, but any suggestions for where to start would be much appreciated!

how should i go about finding a good offsetting scheme? seems there's a lot of green-washing in this space. for example reforestation is attractive, but the forest has to remain for hundreds if not thousands of years. it's hard to imagine that many countries in the world have the level of juriprudence required to last that long!

so how can i find a scheme that really does reduce human emissions in the short term?

strategies i can think of are:

* look for some sort of governing body that regulates and rates these schemes (doesn't seem to be any though)
* find respectable companies that have pledged to go carbon neutral and invest in the same schemes as them (but who?)
* find some environmental charaties and invest in the schemes they recommend (but most charities are against them)

i have enjoyed using it and try to take it with me everywhere i go (even in these pandemic times, which is not very far tbh). 

last week i took it to my local starbucks to order a medium coldbrew with a shot of almond milk. it just fitted in my cup the batista said to me. i live in the nl so i think sizing is different here. i paid and they used this ceramic coffeecup from starbucks to put my reusable coffee cup in and put a piece of paper with my order on there.
i was already thinking; okay they are probably using more resources already when using this cup instead of just taking the plastic but kind of shrugged it of. 

but than i saw they just made the drink in a plastic cup and after casually poured it in my reusable cup! i was kind of taken aback by this. what is the point of me bringing this reusable cup when they are just going to use the plastic one to measure the drink and dirty another ceramic cup to put my reusable one in?!

do you have any thoughts about this? i have also seen that starbucks sells its own reusable cups. i am wondering if they then also use the extra plastic. but i don't want to buy another cup just so they don't use the extra plastic when i get coffee there. and buying the extra cup when it is also not really necessary kind of defeats the purpose...

i know it is only a small act in trying to live more sustainably but i think that it's these small changes in your live that add up and can make a change. and it kind of angers me when even these small acts are defeated.

like many, including the documenter himself, i had no idea about most of this. one thing i wish the film spent more time on is how we are to save the ocean. at the very end, they had tips that included:

1. ""no take"" zones must be established and enforced
2. governments must stop harmful subsidies
3. avoid eating marine animals

while these are great, it does not go into at all how these are to be done. how are you going to establish and enforce ""no take"" zones? what needs to go into that? how do we start doing that? i would assume the answer, like most every question relating to big issues, is to vote for the politicians that are elected to figure these questions out.

so, brief background: i started my ethical/sustainable journey by shopping second-hand, cutting out animal products and items made from factories and stores that are not certified humane. i've been working on cutting out plastics next. 

i've reached a pickle in my journey, in relation to when you have to buy new products rather than second-hand.

during my research, i learned that many alternatives to animal products, such as viscose leather, lead to massive deforestation, and sometimes don't last as long as products made of leather or suede, so i'm not sure if i should be purchasing animal products, or items that contribute to deforestation efforts. my question here, is how do you balance sustainable shopping with ethical shopping? bonus question, but when it comes to products that have no ethical alternative, (like buying phones, tech products, etc.) how do you work around that or try to balance it in your life?

1,"reducing meat and dairy consumption on a low fodmaps diet i've been lurking here for awhile and haven't seen this issue raised. i'm wondering if anyone has managed to shift their diet in a more plant-based direction while doing a very restrictive diet like low fodmaps. 

if you don't know what that is, consider yourself fortunate. basically it's a sensitivity to the complex sugars in a lot of foods- wheat, onion, garlic, stonefruit and apples/pears, brassica vegetables, legumes and lactose. additionally i have the misfortune of not tolerating unfermented soy at all, or carrageenan, which rules out a lot of non-dairy milks which has that as a thickener. 

it was actually my first attempt at being vegetarian that made me so sick, after some fried tofu, i thought i had poisoned myself. nope, just can't eat unfermented tofu. anyway, i've been doing low fodmaps for 5 years now and it's been completely life changing. no more being up sick all night, no more pain so bad i'm crying in bed waiting for painkillers to start working, no more meals of plain rice. i can exercise outside now and go on long walks without worry or pain. it's really improved my well being so much.

at the same time i care about the planet and want to reduce my impact on it through the food i eat. now that my symptoms are under control so much better, i've been able to reintroduce many things i couldn't eat before, like some wheat, a small amount of brassica vegetables, the occasional quarter avocado. i've been able to reintroduce some legumes too, and have got to the point where i can eat small portions of navy beans or fava beans with a dose of beano, plus giving my digestive system a good weeklong break between doses to recover. so far, so good! 

anyway, has anyone else dealt with this? i feel like we usually talk about diet as an ethical choice, and less about the restrictions people may have that make going vegetarian or vegan more difficult. there are some vegan fodmap bloggers/instagrammers out there, but they seem to be able to tolerate way more beans and brassicas than i can - i really can't afford to overdo it and flare up for days. 

thanks for any advice and commiseration!",0.1733

1,"seaspiracy and the truth, let’s discuss seaspiracy and the truth, let’s discuss.

hello everyone, i just first want to say my intention with this post is to come closer to the truth and have positive discussion. a little about my background, i haven’t finished school yet but i have completed 3 years studying conservation biology and i’m very passionate about the environment and specifically oceans. i watched seaspiracy last night and it shook me to my core, which i’m sure most people would feel watching it. i was shocked and disgusted about the information in this documentary and never realized the extent to which the fishing industry was so horrible for the environment and for animal life. i knew about by catch, plastic pollution, carbon storing in the ocean, etc. but this documentary seemed to take things to another level. 

i wanted to learn more and look up reviews and fact checks of the documentary so i could be as unbiased and close to the truth of what is happening as possible. the issue so far seems very polarized— a lot of pro-fishing sources say the documentary is conspiracy, bs, and uses outdated or debunked sources and truth bending reporting basically. the ny times said it’s not really great. of course there are a lot of sources, pro vegan and environment, saying the exact opposite. personally my intuition tells me that these issues are pretty awful and not far from what was shown, however i do have a bias with my background and my feelings and am on the path of going vegan with or without watching this doc. i don’t want to be blind to the reality if this is not the case though, and this documentary is highly sensationalized. i’m having a hard time finding sources that show where facts in the documentary came from or where they were refuted (maybe i just need to research myself). 

regardless, i feel like so many issues are so polarized in today’s world that it creates no change at all, each side is pissed at the other and unwilling to budge because of the attitude and treatment of the other. of course i’m passionate but as i’ve gotten older i’ve realized that the reality of conservation issues (and other social issues) need to involve some sort of compromise and will have to start a lot smaller to begin at all. for example, instead of demonizing people for certain practices, especially in other cultures (dolphin killing, whaling, shark finning as touched on in the doc) recognizing that many of these people do not have another choice given the circumstances they live in and that the world and society sets people up with horrible choices sometimes. of course i don’t condone any of this, but who am i to judge and even say that something is so morally wrong from such a place of privilege? in my opinion, we can’t just eliminate the fishing industry overnight. we need to provide people alternatives, economic incentives and support to begin changing these issues and go about restoring wildlife populations, because humans focus on humans first and that’s just the world we live in. of course going vegan is great but you can’t force that onto another person no matter how much you try, you can only live by example. 

anyway... i think sensationalized reporting on either side of an issue can only go so far and i feel can actually make issues harder to change. so i guess with all of this in mind i want to know what your thoughts are on the documentary, this issue in general, and if you have learned about the validity of this information? i would greatly appreciate any insight and perspective that anyone has to offer. :) lol also i know this was a lot of information, thank you for reading my ramblings.",-0.8108

1,"environmental economics discussing population as a problem my course in environmental economics has been discussing population as a problem. we have spent time discussing population limits and ways to lower population, but briefly came to the conclusion that there is nothing we can do to stop people from having children. i’m not sure if that lesson was impactful enough because we never discussed any real complex problems. we were basically discussing eugenics, but never called it that. i doubt my professor wants to demonize this topic, but i am more... focused on ethics and social justice from my own studies so this is a concern for me.

although from an economics stand point these courses are focused on capitalism and to keep the economy going we need constant resources to extract according to demand. through this simple notion population instinctually is the problem if we want to protect resources. 

this course while not focused on ethics has a larger ethics problem in my eyes. honestly i feel like this lesson very i outdated and misleading but this could just be the nature of economic courses.

1,"barriers to change in agriculture  a large number of posts on this sub are relating to food production. possibly disproportionately so to other sectors, but that's okay. it's a great topic for people to engage on, we all make daily choices about food and have at least some understanding of it's production. i work as a researcher in this area and it really is great to see the engagement.

i wanted to talk a bit about barriers to change in agriculture. it's an incredibly tough industry to change compared to many others.

my experience is predominantly in the uk livestock sector as a researcher in animal health/welfare and sustainability/environmental mitigatin. this may be slightly contexualised in that way, though much of it will apply more widely. i have worked on other topics though (wheat production in china, consequences of deforestation in malaysia etc).

of course this does not cover everything. there are also exceptions and theories to address these things. these aren't necessarily my views, but simply factors that are important in this area. i'm not here to specifcially critique or criticise anything in particular or to be pro/anti anything. i just wanted to give food for thought for when we are all discussing agriculture.

**farming consists of lots of small businesses**

if you want to make a change in the automotive industry, that change applies across a small number of huge players. in agriculture it's the opposite, you have a huge number of small players. thousands and thousands of farms. this makes change very difficult to implement and, if legislative, difficult to monitor.

**apples and oranges**

legislation itself is very diffiult. two factories can be compared like-to-like as they're entirely artificial constructs. two farms cannot. they have different soil, climate, slope aspect, local fauna and flora etc. it's incredibly difficult to compare one farm to another. there's a lot of talk about benchmarking farms for efficiency, but it's near impossible to do. legislation, by it's very nature, is broad. broad policies don't work well in farming due to how unique each farm is.

p.s. for those who do not know the phrase ""comparing apples and oranges"" is a phrase that means comparing two things that are not alike enough to make a valid comparision.

**farms are family businesses**

in terms of land-use. it's difficult from a social perspective to change. if you grew up on the farm with your grandparents rearing cattle and now its in your hands, it's natural to want to continue that tradition.

this also creates an issue for policy. if you make a policy in industry and a business collapses because they don't adapt or follow the rules, then it can be seen as progress and market forces. in agriculture it's not some anonymous business that collapses. it's a family, who live on the farm and whose entire lives revolve around it. this also means the topic is very much in the heart of many people involved in agriculture.

**capital and liquidity**

change costs. in most countries farmers are relatively poor. those that are rich are usually asset rich, capital poor. e.g. there net-worth is tied up in land and machinery and they have little money in the bank. this makes upgrading systems very difficult. 

furthermore, it makes risk difficult to manage. if you change a system that's worked and your experiment fails, then you are in big trouble financially. i saw this a lot in china. farmers would knowingly use far too much fertiliser. doing so guaranteed them about 90% of their maximum possible yields. if they tried to be accurate aiming for 100% of their potential yield, and undercalculated, they might only hit 70-80%.

finally, in many developing nations, rural households live week to week. they simply can't afford to implement long-term strategies if there is a short-term loss to food and economic security.

**profitting from assets**

for many farmers, their assets (land) are their primary source of security. they therefore need to use that to create income. in some areas, you have choice in how you do this (e.g. which crop). in others, you have far less choice - some land isn't suitable for arrable crops and therefore pasture for grazing is the logical economic step for the land owner. essentially, the value of that land is driven by its agricultural capabilities and returns.

of course, we talk about rewilding such areas, but so long as it is under private ownership, the owner can't be expected to do that if it returns no financial rewards. if you make the livestock production less profitable (e.g. change subsidies) we then hit this next hurdle:

**votes**

rural voters are hugely important in most countires. usually because rural areas are large so you end up with a lot of constituencies/districts covered by rural communities, despite relatively small populations. this means that winning rural votes is often key to power. therefore, there is a reluctancy to introduce radical farming policies that could be received negatively.",0.9742

so, my question is, would it be unethical to sell this one and then buy a new one? it just seems much cheaper to get a new one. i don't want to be wasteful, but i think if i sell it someone will repair and sell it so its not as if i am just tossing it. if i go that route, should i go for another refurb, in order to minimize waste, or get a new one in hopes that if i take good care of the next one i could possibly get it to last longer? if i do go for another phone, any recommendations on the most ethical products? i distinctly remember buying the galaxy s8 because i thought the materials were more ethically sourced than it's competitors, but now i cant find whatever article led me to believe that in the first place. i would like a pixel because of the camera, but still need to look into those more. i live in the us, so fairphone is unfortunately not an option. thanks in advance!",-0.8914

this one blows peoples minds, but i’m serious. using a tablet for note taking instead of paper is actually more sustainable. the carbon footprint of a whole day’s charge of an ipad is the same as a single sheet of paper. apple is also really good at recycling older devices to get new parts to produce their new devices. a way to reduce the price of a tablet is to get one one generation behind. you can get huge discounts this way; i know apple sells older ipads for $300 less than they used to retail at. and getting one refurbished is great as you didn’t create demand for new materials as much as you would buying a completely new device. 

3. walk > the bus > uber/own car 
walk wherever you can. whenever it’s march-november at my university i walk to college town whenever my friends and i go out. but if you have to take a vehicle somewhere, take the bus. your weight being on the bus technically creates more gas consumption, but that’s better than using a vehicle of you own somewhere. also taking the bus at my university is free, so i’d much rather take that than an uber or lyft somewhere.",0.9929

i'm currently doing some research for a university design project.

i'm looking at creating a vision for communities of the future (or today) that incorporates **everything** required to solve the climate emergency problem.

there are examples of communities that have gone ""100% renewable energy"" or ""net-zero carbon"" and while this is great, there is often a downfall somewhere that negates the gains made by whatever the label given was. an example being sinclair meadows in the uk, the first street to be 'carbon negative' in the uk. this is fantastic, however, it only considers energy use of the homes and materials used in the construction of the houses. the residents could all be eating heavy red-meat diets or not shopping locally and totally wipe out any gains made elsewhere.

the vision i'm looking to create is something where absolutely every consideration, from the physical materials, services, lifestyles, diet, education etc is all pulling in the same direction, and therefore becomes truly 'sustainable' and zero-impact.

i would love your input into this system idea, absolutely anything you can offer positive or negative is welcome and appreciated.

some prompts for you to think about could be:

* perceived relative advantage – over existing systems
* ease of use – of any tangible elements including ergonomic and anthropometric detail of physical and psychological fit
* perceived compatibility – with existing products, services and systems
* perceived value – whether the potential value of a new system is readily seen
* cultural acceptance – whether the system is acceptable to potential users and personnel involved in its delivery

my lifestyle is least sustainable when i'm in a hurry, when i am triggered, when i'm reactive, angry, depressed or anxious, when i'm caught up in my emotions and my mental projections. in those moments, i don't give a shit about the environment, i'm wasteful, i don't shop consciously, i eat unhealthy, etc.

when i slow down, when i become more mindful of the body and my surrounding environment, when i take time to breathe and be aware of the present moment, i find i naturally make more environmentally conscious decisions. it's not an effort, it's easeful and joyful. i'm not longer trying to fill a void within myself through consumerism. 

all of the technological innovations are fantastic for creating a more sustainable society but without a shift in our mental habits, without becoming more aware and mindful, we'll continue down the same path of environmental destruction.

i know the us is a huge country that makes inter-city and cross-country travel by rail difficult, but we have growing energy density in cities and that trend will only continue. why are there only a handful of cities (and mostly on the east coast) with solid public transportation? and why is it so much more expensive to build reliable public transport in the us than it is to do it globally? (preliminary research on the topic cites things like higher wages in us or higher safety standards, but i find it difficult to believe that countries like norway, denmark, or sweden, for instance,  have lower wages or safety standards, and yet their rail projects are still cheaper. i'm sure this is a topic with lots of nuance but anyone have any  incite for me?",0.9726

i’m starting a small batch clothing business with my friend where we will design, upcycle, dye, print/draw/paint on clothing. we are concerned about water waste, and are also looking to rent a warehouse/studio type space to create in. we’ve started dyeing already, at the moment just at home. being an eco conscious business we are of course looking to conserve water. i’m interested in implementing a water catching system, a washer, and sink that can use this water, and any tips or advice on how we can possibly do this. 

i am completely new to anything regarding this process, but would love to figure out a system that would work for us and do the research. we will be in a warehouse space with several private studios and probably only a shared worksink. potentially trying to set everything up outside, or have a portable washer or sink that we can bring out to use with the water, or if there’s any possibility to have the sink and washer inside. we definitely need a washer and the sink would be ideal. also wondering if the rainwater would be good to use or how we can make sure it’s good to use. also keeping in mind we are in a shared warehouse space that may not have hookups or plugs outside, or even drainage ... like i said i believe there is a work sink in the building or at least one outside.

i know it’s a bit of a complicated subject perhaps, but any suggestions, guides, links, products, reads would be highly appreciated!! like i said i am completely not knowledgeable on the subject and need guidance and a point in the right direction! we are trying to figure out a solution asap as we move in and set up our new space and are working on dyeing clothes. we’ve not solidified a spot yet but are hoping to get this studio warehouse space i mentioned, and hoping that this is a feasible process and option in this space.

whether it be composting, cutting out meat, driving an electric car, riding a bike everywhere, using reusable grocery bags, gardening, calling local representatives, engaging in mass protests, educating yourself on climate science, educating others, reducing flights, going childless, replacing your appliances, outfitting your house with solar panels, building mutual aid communities, running for local office to make eco changes, or anything else that will make a difference, **thank you**. you're making sacrifices in your own life to try and help others and the environment, and that is something that needs to be applauded. i hope, if you've faced derision for your lifestyle changes, that you don't let the doomers and non-sustainably minded people get to you. their approval is irrelevant; take solace in the fact that, should we be successful, then the future generations will look back on us with gratitude and appreciation. you're all on the right side of history and, even if we aren't successful, then at least we can say we tried to make things better.

1,"how i finally got a full-time career in renewables a lot of you were interested in how i got to the point of working full-time on sustainability, and i want to share some steps anyone can take to make sustainability a wider and wider part of their professional journey:

1. regardless of your major, background, or your current job situation, sustainability can be applied anywhere.  if you are thinking about it and noticing ways things could be improved --congratulations, you are already working on sustainability.
2. at this stage, it really helps to have a few allies--i guarantee there is at least one other person who has noticed the same problem at your work or school.  they too are thinking to themselves, wow, that's really wasteful and unnecessary; and they too are probably feeling like the only person noticing it.  as hard as it is, the best way to find these fellow sustainability-heroes is to speak up about whatever you've noticed could be improved to be more sustainable.  (this could be a whole post in itself, but the key is to be strategic in when and how you bring it up.  any area of waste almost always ties to financial waste too, so try to find a way to verbalize it as a potential financial win.  then it is palatable to almost everyone, and you've also now identified yourself to others who were thinking the same thing from a sustainability standpoint.)
3. the next step is doing something about it--a change, no matter how small.  starting this is the hardest step.  i've found once you get things going, you naturally build momentum and confidence that sustainability is something *you* do.  you may also build a handy set of leadership skills in the process.
4. finally, rinse and repeat.  do enough times that you've built the credibility to work on this stuff full-time, if that's what you wish.  and, by the way, there's nothing wrong with integrating this into your life / existing work and never making a big career jump.  we need people who are conscious of waste and sustainability-aware in all walks of life.  this is going to be a huge lift for society, and we need ""lay people"" thinking about it too.",0.9691

1,"product packaging thread all,

i would love to get a discussion going on what the best packaging is for food/consumer products. this will be a portion of the economy that people can visually associate with environmental efforts and i would like to understand the next level of this. 

 criteria for this is:

* ability to seal product from environment
* biodegradability/ recyclability/ persistence in environment
* ability to have additional marketing on the medium (and sustainability of additional marketing)
* land use of medium
* toxicity during production and lifespan of medium
* energy consumption of medium

obviously certain packaging is better for certain items, so please discern as much as you please.

my judgements are as follows:

* general solids packaging (chips, bars, bags of flour)- i personally like aluminum foil-esque products due to recyclability. i encasement is required (typically not and is something that could be removed in food packaging) cardboard due to recyclability and biodegradability
* liquids: aluminum due to recyclability and glass. glass recycle chain is not as developed.
* semi-solids (toothpaste) : this is tough. personally i prefer aluminum (recyclability) with some sort of aluminum device to scoop it out.
* packaging material: cardboard boxes are good. packing peanuts/ bubble can be reduced with some sort of wood/fiber/ cloth product that is more biodegradable
* food takeout: biodegradable wood/ fiber substrate. this one is the most egregious due to high styrofoam use and should be eliminated.

in all this i realize plastic is good for being able to see the quality of the product before using, but i thing that this is overrated. we don't see a lot of products before utilization and if we can reduce the wear and tear of the planet then we can sacrifice this ""convenience.""

i look forward to hearing any opinions and hope that this can be a thread to spread some cool ideas.",0.9749

1,"sustainability and gamestop: the stock market as a powerful force for sustainability tl;dr: if we banded together, we could utilize our strong influence on the stock market to promote sustainable practices in corporations. we can take control like never before!

like everyone else, i have mystified by what happened with gamestop story. how is it that a “small” group of people on one subreddit brought the whole financial world to its knees?

i think we are at the dawn of a new era where we can have a large influence on how corporations operate. if you actually go to r/wallstreetbets you’ll see how many people are in this not for pure financial gain but to make a statement, a statement against the 1%. in this way, ironically, they were more successful at getting wall street/congress to listen than the occupy wall street movement. hedge funds are no longer going to short companies out of existence because they know we can disrupt their nonsense. 

but what if, instead of just doing this one time event to specifically “stick it to the man,” we did it to specifically target sustainability in business. what if we all invested in a company that actually attained 100% renewable energy? what if we all though to sell a company that didn’t reach its sustainability pledge?

the weapon and source of power in our era is money. r/wallstreetbets proved the market is just a damn game. but what if we made it into something more? what if we made it a way to take back control of what we want to see happen in our world?

this is just a thought. i don’t have concrete plans of how to pull this off. but i think we should all be aware of the power we have if we banded together.",0.7901

1,"i think it is hard to find users for green projects where the direct benefits are not big (but contamination is reduced for instance). i'm facing it  this  is only an idea, i haven't developed anything at this moment, but i  have been thinking and discussing about this for the whole last year.

the  objective of this project is to help in the task of reducing methane  emissions, concretely i focused on farms (this is such a big source of  methane).

the aim of the project  is to connect farmers with biogas companies, so the manure (waste  generated by animals such as pigs or cows) can be used to generate clean  energy (biogas),  instead of being storaged (in that case, the methane  shall be released to the atmosphere, and that is a well-known  contamination problem, and 2030 agenda aims to reduce this among other  objectives). as far as i know, there is no penalty for that  contamination.

the main point of  the idea is to organize farms subscribed to the same biogas plant within  each small region, so the transport would collect the manure from farms  near the plant and would deliver it there in order to generate biogas.

the  main issue found here is that the farmers won't be motivated to  register to this service, even if they help to take care of the  environment by doing this (generating clean energy, helping biogas  companies to create more plants, and reducing the amount of methane  released). honestly, i do think they won't find any direct benefit (even  if they are helping the environment), because i am not adding any real  value for them. they wouldn't obtain discounts for supplies for  instance.

the only way i have  found to ""motivate"" the farmers to register is to also allow them to do  business within the platform (such as post ads, bargain between farmers  that are not near enough to negotiate face to face, or let company  supplies to register there too). it would be like a professional network  but oriented to their sector (i.e. startups, companies, farmers would  be able to exchange products, services or feedback even if they are  maybe too far to talk face-to-face).

how would you motivate potential users to use green solutions, even if they don't obtain a direct benefit from it?

1,"sustainable bands for apple watch? my partner would like to get me an apple watch for my birthday. i am possibly coming around to the idea for the functionality i would be able to get out of it. 

however, can i make a (very slightly) lower impact and improve the sustainability of my product purchase with the material/band selection? 

the band material options include: 
-liquid silicone rubber (lsr)
-polyester yarn braided around silicone thread (description says it is made from 100% recycled material)
-fluoroelastomer 
-woven nylon
-leather
-stainless steel

synthetics (nylon, polyester) are not biodegradable and rely on petrochem for the raw material. however the polyester yarn braided around silicone thread is made from 100% recycled material so would that be better than creating demand for newly extracted materials?

silicones are made from sand, but from my rudimentary research, lsr is a synthetic resin. also fluoroelastomer is a synthetic rubber. so is there really a benefit to either of those materials? 

leather- is presumably made from some animal, though i am not sure where to find details about it. it can be made from skin from animals raised for their meat so it can be a byproduct and doesn’t need additional land and resources, and is generally fairly durable. 

stainless steel- could be made with some quantity of recycled content in it. is the resources to fill the demand of creating it higher than the other options? 

is there something else i can think about to try to reduce impact while making this purchase? i am still concerned about what could happen at the end of life of the product, but perhaps apple will be doing smart watch recycling then too in addition to their current old devices program. 

the case comes in aluminum, stainless steel, or titanium. i would likely get aluminum, but am open to reasons for the others if it makes sense.",0.9179

1,"are there any material resources which, if suddenly not available, would halt or challenge future technical development? hi! i’m currently watching a short youtumentary about climate change where they touched upon recycling steel. i observed in the footage that what they were melting contained a lot of other (likely valuable) materials that would just burn and become gas or ash. i had to pause and find this subreddit, because the question that came to my mind scares me. the question is in the title, but the longer question is as follows:

**are there any materials (e.g. elements of the periodic table or natural resources) which, if not available due to being overlooked and obliterated as part of previous recycling efforts of another resource, would halt or significantly delay or challenge the future technical development in any specific field?**

for example, ”without resource x, we will not be able to make anymore screens for tvs or smartphones” or ”without resource y, we will not be able to make anymore computer chips, ever”. 

(another way to ask the same question would be: ”if we obliterated every existing occurence of a specific element of the periodic table (e.g. gold), would it make future development impossible within any technical development areas?”)

the question is of concern for me, because i do encourage recycling efforts. however, if such efforts mean that we little by little obliterate necessary material that we can’t renew within reasonable time, i don’t know how to cope.",-0.8792

for example, one of my questions was 'how much energy can be saved by replacing traditional side-mirrors of cars with digital mirrors? they are smaller in size and thus reduce drag, increasing fuel economy. 

now, this question is not really 'feasible', because it's impossible to fit all existing cars with this technology. however, in the future these digital mirrors might the the standard and the efficiency gain of drag reduction is 'free'.

this is just one question regarding the category transportation/mobility/cars, but it could be anything as long as it's connected to sustainability.

1,"distraught over city recycling being canceled. shit, where to start? my husband and i moved to abilene, tx one year ago. population 123k. closest larger town is ft worth, 151 miles away. had to move here for work. was devastated when i found out they had stopped recycling plastic and glass here right before we had moved. i mean, i cannot take my glass or plastic anywhere to be recycled. i do have a local grocery store that accepts plastic film, thankfully, and for the past year i could recycle paper, cardboard, aluminum, and bi metal cans.

i have always been fairly eco conscious but know i could do more, this past year i have been trying more than ever to drastically reduce my waste. i've had a vegetable garden for many years and managed to grow a decent amount in the small garden here, i reuse shipping supplies when i can for my small business, i cook 90% of our meals, even made eco friendly gift baskets(sans basket) for family and friends this xmas. i try and purchase recycled items when i can. anyway,, won't go into too much more detail, i know there is always room for more changes, but damn if i'm not trying! and making a lot of improvements. 

unfortunately, there are a lot of things that i have to get delivered to my home, including lots of medical, art, and business supplies. it's been even worse in the pandemic. being a smaller town, there are not a lot of stores and zero stores that offer bulk shopping options. 

then, several days ago this piece of crap city announced that they will stop recycling paper and cardboard at the end of the month. i am freaking the fuck out. paper and cardboard.

when it comes to recycling and reducing waste, i already feel so helpless. the government and businesses are not making good choices and we are paying the price. all we can do is vote, sign petitions, write angry letters, try to educate others, and try to make smarter choices when purchasing things. but, we aren't given many good choices as consumers, we usually have to settle for something that is ""better than what i was doing before but not good enough"". oh yeah, and we can recycle! now they've taken that away from me. i feel so fucking helpless. i know that there has been a big problem with recycling facilities all over the country, there aren't enough and they aren't efficient and they cost money. but what the fuck am i supposed to do?! 

shit. i guess i just need some folks with similar concerns for the environment to hear my rant. my emotions are already raw from months of quarantine and this is just, rough.

1,"has the pandemic changed your way of thinking about sustainable living?  

i am wondering if people are now taking their ability to survive at their homes for long periods without shopping every day more seriously and if that will be a trend for the future.

i have been off grid 20 years now and have always kept at least 3 months of dried and canned goods on hand and have the equipment and skills to hunt and fish if necessary and i have chickens for eggs but the pandemic raised my awareness as to areas where my supplies and lifestyle was not as sustainable as i had assumed.

for one thing i found out fast that having stored foods is great but having lots of just the same foods stored get's boring fast so i added several varieties of canned vegetables and increased my canned fruit, cereals and pasta variations so meals are not boring and more appetizing.

i found out that having condiments and seasonings stored is also necessary and salsa, cheese, and things i use all the time like jalapeno's and of course coffee, sugar, salt, flour, pancake and other bread mixes needed more attention than i was giving them.

paper goods became vital and while i live alone most of the time i could see a real need for people to have tp, sanitary supplies, soap and other bathing and cleaning supplies stocked up. i went through my paper towels, clorox and cleaning supplies very fast and had tp make my own out of old towels and basics like vinegar.

medications became a lot more important and while i don't need any prescription meds thankfully, many people do and i stocked up on oc stuff like ibuprofen, allergy and cold medicines and refilled my first aid kit for bandages, ointments and i got a digital thermometer, b cuff and o2 tester so i could do basic testing at home. people with diabetes need to consider their testing supplies and medicine supply line.

fuels for my propane water heater, furnace and cooking had to be refilled more and gas for a generator. i cut extra firewood in case i needed that for heat but so far not needed. trucks were all serviced and ready for winter but i added solar trickle chargers to keep batts full since i am driving less these days.

dog food and chicken food was another area i was deficient in and so i triples my usual supplies so i can keep them fed a few months without a trip for food and if you have animals you may also need other supplies and medications on hand.

keeping myself entertained and busy took on new meaning and i pulled down my old guitar and restrung it and started playing and writing songs again and i am learning to whittle and working on small projects around the cabin. the internet has been vey useful for contacting family and keeping my small business going and was vital for getting local news as was my emergency radio. i added a 100 watt solar panel and 100ah battery just for a charging station for the laptop, radio, and other gadgets i use all the time. my book collection was poor so i borrowed books from family and ordered a few online.

online shopping became my go to instead of local and you of course need accounts and a way to pay for stuff online. if you do that. you might consider a paypal account or debit card instead of credit cards that can get you in debt trouble.

so, that is my learning experience from the pandemic and areas i needed to address and if you have other areas or ideas that we should be considering please put them in the comments so people can be better prepared and maybe this will become a trend that will help people survive anything that might force us to be more sustainable for long stays at home.

it doesn't even need much effort just eat more vegetables and eco food. dont leave lamps on.
if no one is in the room. if everyone would do this it would make a huge difference i think. but some people say that they will not live when the climate change is worst. that's fucking selfish. our grandchildren,children and future generations will live then. and if we dont act now they will grow up in an world where tsunamis and other disasters are completely normal. and the worst thing about it. they cant do a fucking thing about it. we the children of today must act now.
it doesn't even need much effort. do one thing. just imagine the whole world doing small thing together. that could possibly work. the big problem is that people dont realize how serious this problem is before it hits hard and then its too late. the only thing the future people can do is to wait for thier death.  some adults are fucking dumb.
i'm a teenager and today i realized how serious this problem really is. i started crying because this is literally the start of the end of this planet. but we cant give up. as of today i will take this problem seriously. the thing is before today i didn't care a thing about climate change. but today i realized how dumb and stupid i have been. we must continue to protest,talk spread this problem so every kid in the world. understand that this is a really serious problem.

also i was wondering if there are podcasts like this out there already (doesn't matter for the class, my topic has been approved already) and if not, would you be interested in listening if it existed?

like most years, my lovely husband and i will be hosting a new years eve party this year (we live in australia in a state with only 4 internationally acquired covid cases in hotel quarantine, don’t worry!) and i’m wondering about people’s ideas for sustainable alternatives to sparklers and party poppers. last year, at my husband’s insistence, we supplied these to our guests to celebrate the new year, but i felt awful about the impact of them - not to mention that our guests generally left all of their trash on the ground afterwards, leaving us to clean it up the next day. 

i know that he’s going to make the same arguments this year about having fun and whatever, but he doesn’t value everyday sustainability as much as i do - does anyone have any ideas or things that they’ve used in the past to combat the use of sparklers and party poppers that i can use in a counter argument?

hi there! a few months ago, i pitched a plan for a campus-wide (and hopefully local residents too) food waste initiative. i won't go into details because there was a lot that went into it, but basically last month they gave me a huge grant to get it started and a job at the sustainability office. i have been tirelessly trying to get everything together and it's been exhausting (but worth it).

**anyway,** here's the irony of this post:

i never leave things to the last minute, but i've been so busy with the food waste project that i haven't been managing my finals schedule well. for my sustainable agriculture class, i am writing a relatively long research essay on **fighting food waste in america** and i'm supposed to describe the situation for half the essay and then spend the other half talking about **an existing method of preventing waste from occurring and about an existing method of recycling the waste**. i'm not talking about at a household level; **it has to be something larger scale (retailers/gov't/etc)**.

i originally was going to do the first half about **standardized date labeling and the second about centralized composting** but i ran into an issue. i wrote the composting half, but **i cannot figure out how in the world to write 5-6 pages about standardized date labeling, and can't find an alternative that seems any more doable. does anyone have any suggestions (or more info about date labeling)?**

it can't be about consumer education.",-0.6273
1,"why is equilibrium climate sensitivity dependent on the initial co2 levels? equilibrium climate sensitivity is the higher long-term increase in global average temperature expected to occur after the effects of a doubled co
2 concentration have had time to reach a steady-state. estimates put this metric to be somewhere from 1.5 to 4.5 degrees celsius for earth currently.

i was looking at the ccm3 and chou models [here] (http://forecast.uchicago.edu/projects/full_spectrum.html)
and it looks like, all conditions kept the same, the change from increasing co2 from 100 to 200ppm is smaller than 200 to 400ppm, which is smaller than the change from 400 to 800ppm, and so on. 

is this just because there is some sort of underlying linear or increasing relationship between co2 concentrations and temperature, so since each subsequent doubling has a larger raw difference (100->200 is 100ppm difference, but 600 ->1200ppm is 600ppm difference, and the 600->1200 leads to a larger temperature change)? what could be the actual reason?

if this is the case, then how can we define an equilibrium climate sensitivity? there is no fixed change for a doubling of co2, it seems to depend on the initial co2 levels (as of course, that deems how much you are going to increase the co2 levels by in a doubling). there would seemingly need to be a qualification on what level that doubling is occurring at.",0.5514

it is a crushing feeling.

so i am thinking of building an app, like a daily diary of actions. where we can log any action we take throughout the day towards zero-waste or sustainability. it can be a small thing like ""repurposing a jar"" or something more significant such as ""setting up a website to repurpose work related waste""

afterwards these actions can be rated by the community - not some algorithm, not me, not a webmaster, but rather **the community** will rate this action on a scale of 1-10. 

this will serve 2 purposes

1. it will motivate and encourage the user to do more
2. it will give others new ideas on sustainability

1,"offering zero waste home audits tldr: give me a video tour of your home and i'll help you reduce the waste you create for $5. 

hi all! are you curious how you could reduce the waste in your kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room? do you want to simplify your cleaning routine or find better options for maintaining a pet-friendly home?

i'm a sustainability consultant offering a new personalized video ""zero waste audit"" for your home. this is a judgement-free audit. no shame no matter where you are at in your journey or what your goals are (lower waste, low waste, or zero waste). 

what this audit isn't: i will not be selling you any physical products! my core philosophy is to use less or use what you have in a different/better way. there may be an opportunity to switch out a product that you rely on for something more sustainable if you are not a diy kind of person. i can help you with that, but i will at no point accept brand sponsors or push any products for a kick back. 

this is an *introductory rate* to get a feel for how much demand there is for this service and for me to assess how much time a typical audit will take. i'm offering this rate to the first 10 people to pm me.

once i receive your message, we can schedule time for a zoom call. payment can be made after the audit via venmo or paypal.

i hope this is allowed. from the rules it looks like self promotion is ok as long as it isn't frequent.",0.7539

1,"suggestion: how to use the free market to increase the durability of products. the solution is simple: for consumer products that are not expendable and above a certain value (250 usd or something on that order of magnitude) you require that the retailer or manufacturer be willing to take back the product at any given time, safely dispose of it and then give back a certain fraction of the price (probably 50% of the sell price), depending on implementation this may be adjusted for inflation. 

how will this solve the problem? simple: the company knows that the customer (or those who picked it up at the scrap yard) will most likely try to return it. thus they will constantly know how much they will eventually have to pay back. they will therefore put money aside and invest it. over time income from the investment will make the company money, and inflation make the payback less significant. thus the company will try to postpone the payment as much as possible. the only way to do this is by making products that last and service them to last longer. and since a given product will return to the company there is a good chance that by stockpiling products one could make disassemly lines whenever a certain amount of of produce has been returned. this would allow for reuse of parts and better recycling of scrap.

* a blog post or other information made by a particular group or company in order to push their product, but the title of the post is changed to something more generalized and unrelated, as if this an article meant to be educational. 
* an individual who claims they've written an article and want us to read it, but then you look and its either ""sponsored by"" or ""cowritten by"" a group or organization. 
* individuals who post things about how you need to check out this cool resource, but upon further digging you realize its them promoting their own content.

*  if you're using a company's post, cite why. a little ""i saw this company article and now i wonder about other similar companies"" or ""this is a company page but has several direct links to the exact terms of xx law and that's what i'm really citing"" go a long way.
* being transparent and upfront when you write an article that it has a sponsor or cowriter, rather than claiming the work to be yours entirely, without any additional input or influence. 
* being transparent and upfront that you're promoting your own business, rather than initially telling someone to just ""check this cool thing out"".

hi plant friends! 

how do you refresh your soil after growing vegetables indoors? 

i have many different containers, of all different sizes, and a variety of different plants in most containers. i started out with pretty good quality soil with all of the necessary components for good drainage etc. i added nutrients as needed. 
i want to fix my soil for the next round of crops as opposed to purchasing new soil for both environmental and economic reasons. 

- should i dump a few containers into a tote, mix in compost and worm castings, and then refill my containers? it seems this would be similar to crop rotation but instead it’s soil rotation. additionally, compost and worm castings would add beneficial microbes and nutrients. all of the drainage material are still there so i would only add more if it needs it. 

is this a good plan or is there something else i can do? perhaps add fertilizer of some sort? 

*i really do want to improve my soil instead of buying/making a new mix, but if that’s not advisable can i dump this in my outdoor raised bed? i am not sure if perlite is bad for the garden/nature. i have a new raised bed that will need soil in the spring regardless. it’s currently sheet compost but will need topsoil and compost in the spring before planting.

is it true that if i consume more than my fair share, that means someone else in the world is consuming less than their fair share?
so, what if we took the average global income (which is about $18,000/year) as a fair benchmark and say that each american only has the right to $18,000 worth of resources per year, and if they are spending more than that (unless they make efforts to purchase fair trade or sustainable products) they are consuming more than they have a right too. 

just wondering if this line of reasoning makes any sense.

all of this is avoidable, in the world there are many people that have some storage capacity empty. this nodes are already functioning and therefore consuming, so it is more respectful for the environment to use this space that is already there but it is unused than create new storage space that is going to contribute to damage the environment.

so due to pandemic isolation, as well as winter encroaching, i have been trying to find ways to accomplish some activism from home. i sent one of those sierra club pre-formatted emails regarding the clean economy act to my representative here in wyoming (who happens to be liz cheney), mostly as a low-effort way to do something. i received a canned response back (i'm well aware this does not come from my rep herself), which is in line with cheney's stances on the environment on her website, including reducing regulations, the epa, and trying to further carbon-capture technology (while increasing coal and oil usage).

i really want to write a counter-response, both as a way to debate these stances, as well as get her/her team's reasonings behind their positions. i hardly hope to change any opinions, more to put them on record for some of these things.

however, i have done some research into the types of fabric used to make my clothes and have a good idea about which ones shed microplastics. i have researched hemp, cotton, organic cotton, acrylic, polyester, etc., etc... i also realize that looking at the label on a piece of clothing does not always tell you all the information you need about a piece of clothing.

but... i can't seem to find an alternative to elastane. i know that natural rubber is biodegradable and plant-sourced but rubber can dry out and become brittle. which, in turn, does not make it ideal for a person's bra or undergarment that requires some give to it. i am not interested in getting a corset - it is a pain to move in.

1,"""reducing individual impact is a lie sold by corporations to shift the blame to the consumer"" i hear this claim a lot, and often the conclusion is that there is no point trying to reduce your individual impact.

to me, it seems largely a cop-out. it is obvious to me that i can't expect anyone to reduce their negative impact to an actually sustainable level while still participating in current western society because industry and governments are not offering us sustainable options.

i think there is truth to the claim, but i also think it's a defeatist attitude that rejects the exponential effects that a passionate individual can have on reducing society's impact as a whole. 

policy-makers and ceos are individuals after all - and people like david attenborough have a huge positive impact on bringing awareness to the situation, out-weighing the fact that they (""hypocritically"") are using unsustainable methods like air travel to do so.

the op of this post received tickets for this flight as a gift from family, was essentially arguing that it was a waste of time and resources, but stated that their parents should have instead booked him tickets to iceland, where he wanted to go. for reference, there are (via google flights) about 23 ""flights"" a day (one way) that you can choose, and each has at least two layovers. total airtime alone minimum is 5 hours. i believe this was separated into one 3 hour and one 2 hour.

the commenter was arguing the following:

* because you don't go anywhere, the flight is worthless, and therefore wasteful
* with iceland, even if it would technically need more supply, you'd still have a more ""meaningful"" experience, so it would technically offset the issue.
* people taking these flights typically live in the city already, so its a waste.

this was my argument:

* for the one way alone, its going to use up more resources with the additional landing/takeoff, plus more in-air time means more fuel burnt.
* the activity is not ""meaningless"", as this is something that many people would enjoy, some more than iceland. therefore, the trips are equally valid in my opinion when it comes to ""worth of experience"", even if it is a domestic audience.
* with quarantines for entry in iceland, the amount of ppes, single use plastics, disposables, etc possibly used on or for op would be significant for the two weeks, especially in comparison to that not needing to happen domestically.
* i haven't even tried to wrap my brain around the amount of resources spent in addition going around iceland, but there's that, too.

i don't know, what do you guys think about this? from what i see, it was approached in a ""one or the other"" scenario. people arguing iceland vs the flight to nowhere, so that's really where i'd want to keep this. even if the best answer from a pure sustainability standpoint is ""don't go anywhere at all"". 

so which would you pick (iceland or the flight to nowhere) and why?",-0.8448
1,"sustainability risk management - supply chain hi all - a bit new to this space so excuse me in advance if i'm asking something that was previously asked by another member.

i currently work in supply chain and have been tinkering with an idea that i think could be very beneficial for organizations as we continue to be a more interconnected world.  

my questions are:

1) what criteria / data could be used to evaluate an organization with a a sustainability focused lens?  for example, if you wanted to rate a company high, med, low but only using sustainability related kpis to drive the rating - what would those kpis be? 

2) is the data publicly available?  if so, where?  if not, can it be acquired?  if so, how? 

would love to connect with folks who may be interested in chatting more about this topic or anyone who works in esg.  thank you!",0.9546

1,"passion brings me solitude 
i am very sustainable, very passionate about it at least. i go the extra mile and have encompassed everything in my life around the concept; my parenting, my education, my career, my eating, my hobbies, etc. it’s my lifestyle and everyday i am looking for new ways to better it. i have no issue sacrificing, as my father taught me well early in life on the importance of wellness over the cheap comforts of our modern life. i am consumed with the bigger picture, and i am proud of it.
my passion attracts moral people, but those moral people always reach an eye rolling point it seems with my habits and aspirations. i daydream of having a herb garden, vegetables i can cook fresh with for dinner, eggs from the chicken coop, solar panels on my roof, no plastic to be seen. everyone says i need to compromise with normalcy, but i say that the time it’s taking me to make my dream a reality is plenty enough compromise. how can one compromise their dreams, their passions. to me, this has become my purpose of living. it gives me a reason for everything i do from sun up to sun down, as without it the optimism it brings i become straight pessimistic. cynical if you will. i have found the core piece to my identity, and this is in fact number one. 

though i share it with no one in my life, besides my kids- which does count and bring me happiness that no other relation could. i have no friends, no family who i can revel in this passion with regardless. my so has nothing but tension and anxiety when i bring it up, telling me i’m trying to change their way of life... my words are not enough. they don’t want to watch the educational information that is out there out of fear, i can only assumed.. 
i guess i just want someone to tell me that they too feel this way, so i can remind myself the solitude it brings is temporary, or at least worth it.",0.9684

1,"is there any hotel manager or worker, or anyone who can give me some insight? we will start a hotel business in 1st of january but we don't own the place, just rent it for 5 years. that's why we cannot do infrastructural changes. solar panels is something that we really want to add to building but it's really too expensive because of my country's money is 8times worthless than usd. 

my action plan is 
1)water will be filtered them bottled in glass bottles, we don't purchase bottled water whether is in plastic or glass bottles 
2)utilize kitchen scraps for something else for like stock or something else, if not compost them or feed it to goats or chickens 
3)instead of bleach use hydrogen peroxide solutions
4)vinegar and baking soda will still be with us in this journey too
5) **** but i don't know what can i use instead of chlorine based professional dishwasher detergent ******* there is no toxic chemical free eco friendly detergent in my country, or maybe in any other countries. 
6)i will make liquid soap for general cleaning purpose from leftover frying oil.
7)i try to persuade my partners (because we will be in the kitchen we are both chefs) to switch to cloth towels instead of paper ones. 
8)we will use cloth napkins instead of paper ones
9)i will make some basic bathroom products from natural resources (like clay, oil,sugar scrub, facial toners from the pine needles around, body butters, body soaps). and they will be in glass containers. 
10) buy  toothpaste tablets in bulk and put some in bathrooms.
11)*******should we put bamboo toothbrush to bathrooms by default? or is it not a good idea. if they use it and don't take it with them to use it for later uses, isnt that be a lot of waste? but if we don't put it, what would a customer think? 
12) maybe we purchase little tester-sized shampoo bars  in bulk, i'm not really sure about that because if they don't like it or leave it, we can't repurpose or reuse it and it becomes waste. but if we buy liquid shampoo in bulk and put it in pump bottles, anyone can use it as much as they need and we can always fill it? but there would be empty soap containers, and they may not be recycled.
13)instead of single use cotton make up pads, we may be add reusable cotton cloth pads? i know they will be sanitized daily  but how do our guests would feel like? actually why wouldn't they, hotel guests share the same towels, same sheets same pillow cases. 
14)wheat straw instead of plastic ones. not reusable but edible for animals, or compostable.
15)we try to make almost every ingredient and not buy it from stores. but even we do it will be really local and be bought in bulk and in reusable bags 
16)brown paper lined trash bins in the rooms and bathrooms?? 
17)no coffee machines in rooms, but if we decide that people want to make coffee in their rooms, it will be in reusable cups to make it or with french press.
18) beeswax wraps or cloth covers for cups and glasses in the rooms

the thing is i don't really understand a lot about these processes. what i want to know is it is still better for these compostable diapers to go to an energy to waste plant than a regular diaper? i can only imagine that what remains after one of these diapers is incinerated has to be better that what's left after burning traditional disposable diapers. please help!",0.7088

both easy on the eyes and the earth the goal is to make the world a healthier place for everybody by reducing the amount of waste from the clothing industry. the modern minimalist design is designed for harsh workouts. all purchases will have a percentage of proceeds donated to various organizations to continue the fight against various climate issues.

this breezy clothing will be made from recycled polyester, marino wool, as well as bamboo. bamboo is a highly sustainable material that grows 2-3ft per day! our breezy clothing made from bamboo fiber and mixed with a naturally sourced merino wool. this clothing is meant for the gym but it can be worn at anytime and anywhere.

here are my concerns and questions, i've never been in the clothing industry and have no experience when it comes to designing.  i'm wanting to pretty much turn gymshark 180 degree to sustainable. how would i go about designing, creating a tech pack, so i'll know a little more about what fabrics to source out.  i was thinking about hiring someone off of upwork or something and give them the idea then design. the least favorite route, what about going straight to alibaba and searching up gymshark and asking suppliers if they can change it to sustainable? 

also, i'm taking inspirations from gymshark, lululemon, girlfriend collective and i'd also like to know if it's okay to have a design similar to theirs because it's not patented and there isn't much to change maybe expect the fabrics used.  what would the tech pack look like then?

what steps should i take? where can i hire people that can get the job done? this is just the first step and i need it done so i can start sourcing fabrics and manufacturers.

1)t rying to switch to zero waste or close to it and being more mindful about what i buy and how it impacts the environment

2) trying to switch to cruelty free only products

3) i have been vegan food almost a year now, and this is very important to me for ethical and environmental purposes. 

is there any field or degree that would help me make the most difference that aligns with these views and would help me help humanity, the animals and earth? 

i think what we do individually is very important but until it is regulated and corporations themselves have to abide certain rules and keep to sustainable standards, we can't save this beautiful planet we call home. i am not by any means a wealthy individual, so donating and helping fund the good cause is not really an option for me at this moment. i also want to make it clear that, again i am by no means perfect and i started on this journey fairly recently. i am a complete beginner, but i am very passionate about this so i want to make it my job to make a difference.

i’m a 20 year-old university student and i will be graduating next summer. ever since i was 15ish i’ve been dreaming of living in van to travel europe while pursuing my passion of the outdoors (skiing, mountain biking, rock climbing, hiking) and have been saving up money to do so since then. with me graduating next summer, the job market being what it is due to covid and not having any jobs or obligations lined up for the next year or more, i’ve essentially come to the conclusion that it’s now (or rather next summer) or never. 
however i’m having a hard time making an actual decision and pulling the trigger on a van due to the environmental crisis we’re in. i’m passionate about sustainability (am planning on working in the renewable energy sector) and have been trying to live as sustainable as i possibly can. i’ve been buying clothes second hand, buying refurbished electronic devices instead of getting them new, gone vegan (bit of both for environmental and ethical tbf) and am currently starting my zero waste journey. i see buying a van as me just going directly against what i stand for and making all the actions that i listed completely useless because i’ll just be part of the problem like everyone else as i’ll be burning fossil fuels.  i know living in a van is what i want to do and that if i don’t do it i’ll regret it till the day i die but i just can’t figure out whether my stance on sustainability should stand in the way of one of my main dreams/goals in life.

sustainable development goal 1.4 refers to ""ownership and control"" of land, ""and other forms of property"". here’s the full text:


> “goal 1.4: by 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance” (united nations, 2017, p. 26).  
 
 
arguably, this framing reduces land to property, and the relationship to land as one of ownership – a colonial way of thinking. it then universalizes this way of thinking to all cultures and peoples – presumably from an implicit assumption that this is the only way, or the best way, to think of, and relate to, land and our greater environment. here are three quotes on that:


from a paper critiquing the sdgs:


> moreton-robinson (2014), an indigenous scholar located in australia, argues that a logic of possession underpins colonialism. she demonstrates how australia was socially and culturally constructed by the european settler-colonizers as a white possession, the logic of which was indelibly marked by race and subsequently became embedded in many settler nation’s immigration laws as a means to regulate and keep out non-white populations. (pirbhai-illich & martin, 2019, p. 24)


a direct quote from moreton-robinson, referenced in the previous excerpt:


> underpinning property rights, possession entails values, beliefs, norms, and social conventions as well as legal protection as it operates ideologically, discursively, and materially. property rights are derived from the crown, which in the form of the nation-state holds possession. possession and nationhood are thus constituted symbiotically. this leads me to ask whether the form of britishness and national identity that developed in australia is “free of, uninformed, and unshaped by” indigenous sovereignty. in this chapter, i explore how the core values of australian national identity are located within the house that jack built, a nation that in its denial of indigenous sovereignty is perceived to be a white possession. (moreton-robinson, 2015, p. 20).


and here’s a relevant quote from another paper about decolonization and the sustainable development goals that addresses this issue too:


> “…patrick wolfe (1999) emphasizes that settler colonialism is a structure and not an event. in the process of settler colonialism, land is remade into property and human relationships to land are restricted to the relationship of the owner to his property. epistemological,  ontological, and cosmological relationships to land are interred, indeed made pre-modern and backward. made savage. (tuck & wang, 2012, p. 5)


**alternative relationships to land:**

as just one example of different relationships, we could consider many australian indigenous peoples beliefs and ways of being – and how they relate to land and ‘country’. here’s another relevant quote that is best read in the fuller context of the whole paper, but still on its own provides a good overview:


> *yapa* people identify so closely with country that they ‘are’ country. this logic means *yapa* are in relationship with everything in country: *warlalja* includes kinship to people, places, and things. put differently, plants, animals, rocks, and so on, can all have skinnames. *yapa* do not aim to dominate these other things: derivation of ngurrajinta from ngurra reflects that one’s relationships are all *through* and *because of* country, and because one *shares a relationship with* country beings. rather, ‘emphasis [is] placed on shared identity [through ngurra] with others as a basis for social interaction’ (myers 1988; also dousset 2013). because one is in relationship with these things and places, one has obligations to them all. this is law. (patrick & spiers-williams, 2018, p. 147)


(note on terms: yapa literally means ‘people’; often used to mean only ‘warlpiri people’, in context it can mean ‘aboriginal people’ in continental australia. the term ‘ngurra’ has multiple meanings best explained in the full paper, but a quick, oversimplified “translation” is that it refers to country, and the laws and ways of being that stem from it)


importantly, the idea of owning country doesn’t really make sense in this way of being in and knowing the world. that is not to say that the idea of ownership is totally alien either – but that it is understood very differently when country and its beings (plants, rocks, waters) are connected to personhood and identity; considered kin and an extension of self and ancestor. ownership in that sense takes on a quite different meaning to the colonial term, and i have doubts that “ownership and control” as outlined in the sdgs reflects that – or leaves space for it. 


**reconciling these differences:**


even though they critique the sdgs, the authors of the first quote (pirbhai-illich & martin) don’t write them off completely. instead, they suggest that practioners and educators in this space are mindful of the biases inherent to them:


> so although we see the potential of sdg 4.7 to support the development of an education for sustainability that is alternative to the modernist and othering constructions evident in many of the sdgs, because it is tied to the neoliberal agenda of monitoring and measurement of quality, it requires educators who are tasked with implementing it to be critically aware of the discourses outlined above and how they reflect a continuing coloniality of thought. (pirbhai-illich & martin, 2019, p. 23)


in a similar vein, steve patrick (aka wanta jampijinpa pawu-kurlpurlurnu), author of the quote above about alternative relationships to land, eventually arrives at what progress can look like when these “two worlds” are reconciled properly, citing a range of indigenous voices, but also a well-known australian anthropologist’s words from over half a century ago.


> the reality of life in lajamanu is that warlpiri culture is being overwhelmed by a pervasive and powerful euro-australian culture. wanta argues that ngurra-kurlu can provide some stability and guidance in this challenging time. for example, he has identified that most warlpiri feel trapped between two cultures. young people particularly feel that engagement with the mainstream organisations that run lajamanu requires too great a departure from their warlpiri life, while on the other hand the culture of their elders seems increasingly irrelevant. the result is that many people are in a kind of social no-man’s land where the values of neither culture are learned. grappling with this choice causes confusion, apathy, and violence. in some cases youth now know so little of their own culture that they do not even have the luxury of choosing which culture they want to follow. wanta also states that older yapa now have little confidence in their own ideas and therefore are afraid to speak (see also folds 2001). 
> 
> wanta’s goal with ngurra-kurlu is to address this fundamental issue. the message is deceptively simple: warlpiri law and culture once provided people with stability, self esteem and direction. it can still do this if it is reinterpreted in the context of community living. said another way, wanta is promoting the message that it is ‘ok to be warlpiri’. he states that by maintaining a strong identity warlpiri can have good lives and opportunities to engage with the rest of the world, without being smothered by it. 
> 
> wanta’s philosophy is similar to that of other aboriginal leaders, such as arrernte elder rosalie kunoth-monks, who said: 
> 
>> in times where land and culture appear to have forsaken us, what is it that we need to establish more than anything? i put it to you that if we are to accept change then it must not come at the expense of our identity. (kunoth-monks 2007:3) 
> 
> a similar sentiment was expressed by one of australia’s foremost anthropologists, weh stanner in 1968 (reflecting on the previous 30 years). stanner suggests that australians have failed to grasp that: 
> 
>> … on the evidence the aborigines [sic] have always been looking for two things. a decent union of their lives with ours, but on terms that let them preserve their own identity, not their inclusion willy nilly in our scheme of things and a fake identity, but development within a new way of life that has the imprint of their ideas. (stanner 1968:28)
>
> (pawu-kurlpurlurnu & holmes, 2008, p. 9)


thanks for reading if you took the time to get through all that. i’d love to hear peoples thoughts:


* do you agree that the sdgs and sustainability discourse more broadly can / do perpetuate colonial ideas?
* if so, what do you see as the way forward here? new goals? new phrasing? practicing what we have mindfully, like some argue? 
* if so, maybe you can see this same thing represented elsewhere, in another area or issue?
* if not, feel free to share your thoughts on why you disagree. i’m not really here to argue though since i’m very much just learning this stuff. i’ve mostly just come to share some of the interesting quotes from what i’ve learned, and hear what others think!

i would be super grateful if you could share your experience and opinion about eco friendly christmas decorations.

here's some guide questions to help you start:

1. what are your christmas decorations made of?
2. how much money did you spend on eco-friendly christmas decorations?
3. how long did it take to find or make?
4. what are the problems/ difficulties you've got regarding eco-friendly christmas decorations? (too expensive? too much effort to find or make?)

i really appreciate your help, and i hope i could help you to achieve your sustainability goals ;)

i also wish to talk to you personally, so that i could understand your green lifestyle and value better. it would only take you a couple of minutes, and that would help me a lot! i'm a student and i don't have much to give you now, but i promise that you will be the first ones to try my prototypes for free!   if you could kindly spend a little time to have a short conversation, please message me on reddit.

there’s the obvious like reducing consumption of meat and fish.  but then you see lots of issues with deforestation related to soy and palm oil (and this seems to be an ingredient in everything).  and then monoculture agriculture doesn’t seem sustainable either with shipping bees all over the place, so should i be steering away from that (ex almonds)?  once i get here, it feels totally overwhelming - what’s left?

here are my concern and question, do i redesign/design a totally different garment made especially for sustainability, or do i simply change up the fabrics for garments from gymshark and such, which i'm sure there are manufacturers that can do that.  a lot of activewear brands are all almost the same and very easy to replicate....lululemon is what stood out to me the most.  so i can't decide whether to just change the fabrics of what already exists and create a brand around it or design a completely new garment using gymshark and other bigger brands as inspirations.  if i were to design then i'd need to invest in designers, pattern makers, tech pack specialists,s and such.  

i'm willing to do all that i can to make this work and any suggestions anyone can give is highly appreciated.

i’m forming a community for those that want to figure out how we will achieve sustainability within a 10-year timespan by creating effective strategies, today. i’m currently looking for people willing to pioneer this ambitious concept.

if you’re a strategist, then you know that no organization can achieve goals without some type of plan. now, the organization called “humanity” needs for us to combine forces to create effective strategies for achieving the goal of making our world more sustainable.

the idea is that we can create one, unifying, strategic plan that can be developed and followed by anyone that wants to opt-in. starting small, the plan grows as we collectively decide which way we’re heading and how. this will create the effect of giving us some direction and guidance that we can test and refine over time until we **achieve our goals.**

this is a moonshot, by far. or, if you prefer, it’s an “earth shot.” however, if we humans are ever going to overcome the great challenges we face, it’s going to have to be together. our disjointed systems and uncoordinated efforts are not working, and so it makes sense that we have a unifying plan of action to get to our goals in the least amount of time possible. 

if this interests you because you’re someone that wants to see the problem solved, and are willing to put mental energy into seeing that it happens, i’d love to chat. i’m looking for those that have skills or an interest in strategy. tons of experience is not necessary at this point, it’s more about curiosity.

so i'm looking for suggestions for food brands that use sustainable packaging, since the food industry is rife with plastic. preferably ones that have online stores that ship to the us, since it's kind of a toss up whether small or specialty brands will be in a supermarket near me. mainly looking for snacks and jarred or dry goods, since i'm trying to get my perishables from local farmers markets. extra bonus points if they're certified humane. no restrictions on diet.

rice and bread are especially hard to find in anything other than plastic bags near me. and it's hard to tell if things like cereals or crackers use plastic or wax paper liners from the shelf. i've definitely had a cereal that looked like it used a wax paper liner, but i can't remember the brand. and if anyone has a veggie or sweet potato chip that's plastic free, *please* do share. i *love* terra brand, but their bags feel like they use plastic.

some suggestions i've found:

* cabot cheeses use wax paper instead of plastic and are pretty found consistently in the us as far as i'm aware. nonrecyclable, but biodegradable. 
* any canned drink rather than plastic bottles, since cleaned aluminum and cardboard are easier to recycle or biodegradable. glass bottles are great, too, but i think everyone knows that.
* true paper plates instead of styrofoam or plastic. everspring is a pressed paper plate that's heavy duty and microwavable. but even the cheaper flimsy wax paper plates are better in my book. nonrecyclable, but biodegradable. 
* timofey bamboo disposable utensils are relatively affordable and look nice for parties. nonrecyclable, but biodegradable. 

that's about all i've got that's solid, besides that things that normally come in glass jars/cans like soups, canned veggies, and pasta sauces. i don't get preserved fruits often, but i definitely opt for canned instead of the plastic fruit cups, i guess.

chalk comes in paper boxes, and has a relatively high percent of product (usable chalk) that can fit in a volume for shipping. compared to markers, which come in plastic tubes, that are packaged with more plastic. and markers dont seem as durable either. markers can fail if they become dried out, and are just in general more disposable. chalkboads can't really get stained by chalk, compared to whiteboards that get stained by dry erase ink. plus chalkboards are easy to clean, all you need is a mop and some water to get it looking brand new. the university i went to had many chalkboards multiple times as old as i am.

the only negative thing i can think of is the resources it takes to manufacture chalk + chalkboard paint, which even seems less energy + resource intensive than manufacturing whiteboards, markers, and ink.

1,"a sustainable way to shop online (looking for feedback)  a team of people, including myself, have been working to build a browser extension, ethyk, to help you shop sustainably online. a short explanation is that the extension works by finding restaurants and colleges (we are looking to add more businesses) that are certified sustainable by our partners on the websites you visit and then appending a seal to show they are sustainable.

**why i’m releasing a digital comedy show rather than participating in fashion week.**  

by zero waste daniel

in mid-march, when new york’s non-essential business shutdown was first announced, i had already been on the hamster wheel of fashion for over a decade. pandemic aside, a mandatory two week stopdown felt like a scary, but dare i say, welcomed change of pace. 

making and selling clothes out of upcycled fabric scraps in my brooklyn storefront is a world away from holding down a corporate 9 to 5 job. it's more of an all-consuming obsession, that requires as many hours as it takes to get the job done everyday. so i thought that lowering the gate on my store for a few weeks, while i worked from home in an effort to ‘flatten the curve,’ would be completely manageable for me and my business. 

for the first time since launching my brand, *zero waste daniel*, i had some reserves to weather the storm. i finally had a direct to consumer business that was making consistent sales and getting some real buzz. i had just come off of my 4th, and largest, installment of my fashion week series, *sustainable fashion is hilarious,* an unconventional fashion/comedy show, and my way of participating in fashion week, without participating in fashion week. last season’s theme was “*the death of fashion*.” 

the show featured models clad head to toe in my newest offerings, scattered throughout arcadia earth, a 15-room climate change museum. it wasn’t a runway or a presentation. it was a staged protest against greed, and a mock funeral for what it once meant to be a great fashion designer. the models were more than living hangers, they were activists. they marched back and forth with signs demanding to know, “who killed fashion?”  in one room, they showed you how to make an apocalypse survival kit; in another, two model’s led a seance to conjure old trends. there was a guest book where people could leave their sympathies next to an altar covered in photos of great designers and brands gone too soon. everyone *at* the show was *in* the show. *the death of fashion* was a whole mood that night. 

in the final room, before guests left, in lieu of the customary designer’s bow, i read a eulogy for a comically long list of trends no longer considered *en vogue*. 

as people passed through the exit, without being prompted, they began paying their last respects. some jokingly hugged me and offered condolences. others did so seriously.

it was a show, an event, a collection, a party, a performance, and one of our last nights out in new york before covid-19 hit our city. for me, it was also a catharsis. that night, i let go of my hopes and expectations of what my future in fashion might hold.

a few weeks later, i felt the first ripples of the pandemic. one day before the shutdown officially took effect, the owner of a sample room in manhattan frantically called me. she told me that if i didn't come and pick up my unfinished goods within the hour, they would be padlocked inside the building indefinitely. 

i picked up the unfinished order. the next morning i went into autopilot. i put on a mask, went into my  workshop, and began to finish the job one piece at a time. the bulk of my next 2 weeks were not spent working from home, but in my closed store in front of a sewing machine attaching 600 patches to sweatshirts, while my husband, mario, clipped threads and packed orders.

while sewing those patches, i thought back to 2011. that year i was a new independent designer, who had just gotten my first large wholesale order.  i didn’t have the money to produce any goods up-front, nor was i doing the kind of volume that a factory would take on. rather than cancel the order, i sat in my studio and sewed up 100 dresses myself. that time it was my mother who clipped the threads and packed the orders.

now in 2020, as i attached the final patches to my project, in my shut down store, in the middle of a pandemic that had already affected so many, so deeply...i felt a familiar feeling. 

it was the need to survive. when i shipped that order in 2011, i felt like i had walked through a gauntlet. 2020 is a more complicated world with higher stakes. this time, i knew i could ship the order, that was the easy part. now, i had to focus on things even more important than what happens next with my brand. this is about actual survival. 

so what if i would never be a designer who shows their collections at bryant park or lincoln center. i no longer cared that i would never sell to barney’s. they are the victims of the times. my sights have moved on from those outdated symbols of success. 

in 2020, survival *is* success. and with an industry in flux and an uptick in “no new clothes” pledges and sustainability challenges, how do i design for people who are not buying?

how do you feed people who are full?

you don't. you entertain them. it’s the classic “dinner and a movie.” people are stuffed to the gills with clothing, but they’re hungry for entertainment. “more content please!” from tik tok tutorials to reality tv, consumers want fashion all over their screens. the demands of design are evolving. this season’s push towards digital is the perfect time for me to get my show out of fashion week altogether and into a new format where it can reach more people, make more change, do more good, and create less waste.  

the show *is* the product. this collection will be a hybrid series, a mix of clothing and content for sale.

tickets for the first show will be released later this week, and the clothing in it will follow. it won’t be just for new yorkers or fashion people, but for anyone, anywhere, who’s looking for a little entertainment and a laugh.  and if you do find yourself with a craving for clothing, i'm still here surviving and making sweatshirts and joggers out of scraps.

1,"tips for a family opposed to sustainability? how do i deal with a non-sustainable lifestyle? so i (22) lived in another japan for a while. it was not the most sustainable by any means, but i lived on my own in that time, and found myself able to make things work. it took months, but i was actually doing quite well!

the hardest thing for me was having to leave during covid. unfortunately, a series of terrible circumstances meant that i could not live there anymore, and i had to leave. *everything*. *shut. down.* any charity i was trying to get my stuff to wouldn't take it. i couldn't sell my stuff because of the pandemic. any business that i could resell through was closed from a state of emergency. i couldn't take many things with me, as i couldn't afford to pay for extra suitcases, and it wasn't feasible to take some items. even with recycling, i recycled what i could, but its very strict and specific there..some things just couldn't make it. as a result, i desperately sold and gave away what i could, and then tossed the rest. this has made me feel guilty, because it shouldn't have been that way, but it was. 

now, i've moved back to the states, and due to the circumstances i am living with my parents. i get it..there are some things that during covid times make anyone uncomfortable. i no longer bring my reusable bags in for produce because the supermarket has asked me not to, and i cannot buy in bulk here (something i was excited to do because japan didn't allow for bulk buying)...this is just one example.

at home, my parents are even more opposed. i've had to rebuy a lot of things i was forced to abandon in japan, especially with many thrift stores in my area having been closed (i arrived in may) at the time. i always bring my own bags to the store, but my mother gets angry when i go buy something and do not bring home a plastic bag for her, because she likes to save them ""and reuse them as trash bags"". i purchased a coconut husk sponge, and it was thrown out because ""it might damage the pots"", even if it never had. it was replaced with a plastic sponge. even with my own laundry, which i do myself, its a fight. i use wool dryer balls, and i'm accused of ""breaking the laundry"" because of the way they sound when tossed around. i've explained that this is not the case, but i'm never believed. i can't even compost anymore, because my parents think its gross to keep it all week to give to the farmer's market, even when i've tried suggesting we hit two farmer's markets a week to dump. all in all, this change in my lifestyle (which i understand isn't totally my fault, but i'm sure i've contributed to)  is causing me a lot of stress and mental health issues. i try where i can, but its all just very difficult for me.

how do i deal with my family and this non-sustainable situation? i'm hoping to get back on track as soon as i can move out, but i'm still working on getting a job.",-0.9898
1,"ways to up the sustainability in your life i'm still a beginner, and i did not take particular interest in sustainability until about a year ago, so please feel free to correct me or make additional suggestions. 

1. get rid of the beef and dairy: i eat plant based, and this is one of the best things i could do for the environment. all animal product production emits greenhouse gases, but these two are by far the worst. there are so many dairy and meat substitutes you can buy at your grocery store that are just as good. 
2. reduct plastic consumption: out of all the waste you create, plastic is by far the worst. first of all its made from fossil fuels, and they don't biodegrade for 420 ish years. eliminating all waste is impossible but the easiest ways to cut down on your plastic waste are: reusable coffee cups and water bottles, ask if products you buy cannot be wrapped in plastic, and dine in restaurants instead of take out. 
3. take notes on an ipad: this one is weird. at first i thought all the electricity was bad the environment, but that pales in comparison to paper production. a full day's charge of an ipad is the same carbon emission as a single piece of paper (and there's no way you can put everything onto one sheet of paper in a day). i cannot be completely paperless but i take notes on an ipad to reduce the notes paper i use. online school is great for this as most things i turn in are online so i don't even need to submit anything on paper. 
4. be mindful of buying clothes: many clothing retailers come from fast fashion. fast fashion wants you to continuously buy and throw out. wear clothes until they completely wear out. and if you decide that you don't want to wear a piece of clothing anymore, donate it to your local goodwill or thrift store. and when you go a goodwill, look around and see what you like.",-0.9144

1,"instead of melting plastics down to recycle them, wouldn't it be better to shred and glue them together similar to plywood? so plastics are a huge issue right now and especially since china  stopped accepting our plastics almost everything goes to the landfill.  sorting and cleaning everything is also really expensive, and you can't  really mix the plastics because they have different melting points and  would solidify at different rates. furthermore plastic strength degrades  each time they are occasionally recycled. i've been wondering for  awhile then, why isn't there a larger industry based around shredding  and gluing together plastics? you could mix the plastics, they wouldn't  have to be as clean, and in general it could be much cheaper. i guess  this too could have issue with not being able to be recycled that many  times, and you would only be able to create solid objects rather than  thin and flexible shapes.",0.8102

1,"inquinamento atmosferico con la rubrica settimanale #ecosistematerra cerchiamo di capire quali sono inquinanti e la loro provenienza.
l’inquinamento atmosferico è un problema per tutto l’emisfero, per tutto #ecosistematerra, gli inquinanti atmosferici possono essere emessi in un paese ed essere respirati in un altro, poiché l’atmosfera stessa, le correnti, il meteo tutto contribuisce alla propagazione, allo spostamento dei vari inquinanti, determinando così una cattiva qualità dell’aria.

attualmente il particolato, il biossido di azoto e l’azoto troposferico sono considerati i tre inquinanti più significativi che incidono sulla salute umana.

esposizioni prolungati a spicchi di questi inquinanti, variano dal indebolimento del sistema respiratorio fino alla morte prematura.


problematiche di salute possibili
circa il 90% degli abitanti delle città, è esposto a concentrazioni di inquinanti superiori ai livelli di qualità dell’aria, ritenuti dannosi per la salute.
per darvi dei numeri, senza voler spaventar nessuno, si stima che il particolato sottile, riduca l’aspettativa di vita,nell’unione europea, di 8 mesi e più.
una crescente preoccupazione è il benzo(a)pirene, un inquinante cancerogeno, le cui concentrazioni sono superiori alla soglia fissata, a protezione della salute umana, in diverse aree urbane, specie in europa centrale e orientale.

🔘 situazione europea

☑ acidificazione : nelle zone europee interessate da depositi acidi di composti in eccesso di azoto e zolfo è stata ridotta sostanzialmente.


☑ eutrofizzazione : [ problema ambientale dovuto all’introduzione di una quantità eccessiva di nutrienti negli ecosistemi] si registrano purtroppo scarsi progressi, la superficie di ecosistemi sensibili interessata da un eccesso di azoto atmosferico è diminuita ma soltanto in modo lieve


☑ strato di ozono: [ tre molevole di ossigeno legate fra loro, sottile strato, unica protezione dai raggi uv più forti del sole] sensibilmente migliorato, sembra che si auto guarisca, grazie anche alle limitazioni di determinati gas.

la qualità dell’aria dell’europa, però, non è sempre migliorata, in linea con le diminuzioni complessive di emissioni causate dall’uomo [ antropiche ] di inquinanti atmosferici.
le motivazioni possono essere diverse:

☑ è difficile rilevare una chiara relazione tra un decremento delle emissioni e le concentrazioni di inquinanti atmosferiche che vengono rilevate.

☑ il contributo crescente del trasporto di inquinanti atmosferici, verso l’europa da altri paesi nell’emisfero settentrionale.

🔘 fonti di inquinamento atmosferico

l’inquinamento atmosferico non è solo dovuto a fonti antropiche ci sono anche fonti naturali come :
eruzioni vulcaniche, polveri aereo diffuse, spuma del mare, emissioni di composti organici volatili provenienti dalle piante ecc.
ma le fonti antropiche continuano ad avere il peso maggiore, come esempio possiamo citare l’utilizzo di combustibili fossili nella produzione di elettricità, nei trasporti, nell’industria e nelle abitazioni, influenti anche i processi industriali e l’utilizzo di solventi per esempio l’industria chimica e mineraria, il trattamento dei rifiuti ecc.

hello everyone! i am a senior university student about to begin a lengthy year long research project, the last thing required to graduate. my major is in sustainable architecture and built environments, which is a pretty general major where i focus mostly in real estate, energy and building design (i know, random, but i have a lot of interests in the field). the main idea in their major is engineers and other scientists from different fields come up with effective sustainable concepts and technology and people with my degree attempt to implement them in all different ways, particularly architecture and public planning. 

i have figured out my “research problem” generally but i am hoping to gain some specificity in what i am hoping to research. here is generally what i have, i have also written a more formal problem statement for class but this is the gist of it: 

obviously fossil fuels are out of the question for sustainable, environmentally friendly grid electricity infrastructure. nuclear, while the most efficient form an energy standpoint, is expensive and controversial in america. hydroelectric dams and wind turbines are not really an option where i live (az) so i am looking into solar panels (pv) as a viable option for the area (tons of sunlight)

solar panels are somewhat cost effective and likely the best best bet for localized sustainable energy production in my area where currently the grid is 80% coal based production. most solar panels available on the market, however have massive inefficiencies in their energy production and have potential for a land use issue when meeting needs for our current grid needs. this raise the importance of batteries, energy storage, to be used in conjunction with solar panels.

i want to explore how batteries will shape future sustainable energy production and infrastructure in my area (southern arizona). this is still pretty general and i was hoping some of you could help give some cool, currently important ideas for narrowing down my research. again, i am not doing a technical major so this would be more about implementing the technology.

if regenerative farming seems to pop up. and i think most people know that what happens is there is a group of people who say we need to eat less meat (less factory farming) and there is a group of people who says we can farm regeneratively and put carbon back in the soil. then another group says this is not scalable and we shouldn’t be thinking about this, and keep the focus on eating less meat. here is my question. why are these two things (eating less meat overall, and farming in a regenerative manner) mutually exclusive. why can’t we do both? whether you eat meat or you are a vegan, wouldn’t you care about the quality of the soil and farming in a way that nourishes the land and soil, rather than strips it of nutrients? i don’t think the end game of regenerative farming has to be to raise more livestock but rather to regenerate the soil, because if we don’t, that means disaster for all the crops we are growing. why did regenerative farming become sort of this buzzword for trying to eat more meat or anti-veganism? in my mind it’s more about the soil and the ecosystem. i would like the hear some thoughts",-0.1381

today i was strolling around primark (ire) waiting for my partner to buy a present for his mother. (for a little background on myself i am a 21f and a student at uni, so we wouldn't have a lot of money to spare). i had stumbled across the ""wellness"" range that primark were advertising. there were select items of ""organically sourced"" clothing on cardboard hangers, they were promoting glass soap displays and bamboo toothbrushes with the humble co, among other things. all items were reasonably priced. 

i have to admit i was a little taken aback by the stall because primark would be a store i would avoid without question, along with contributing to fast fashion in general. 

i was just wondering if anyone else noticed this, as i had gotten a sponsored ad about this range on social media not long after leaving the store. i wouldn't know a lot about the ethics behind primark but i know enough not to contribute, so i was skeptical about it when i saw it. still, are the company trying to change and redeem themselves or is this another big chain trying to hop on the band wagon because of a popular lifestyle? if anyone would like to share any information with me i would really appreciate it!",0.9164

today i would like to discuss the culture of accepting the concept of billionaires in our society. 

i think this could easily be put in to perspective by a quick ""bezos project"", if you will. 

mr. bezos is currently worth 181,000,000,000 dollars (2020, as far as we know, subject to change).

please now, take the time (it is fast), to calculate how long it will take you to become a bezos.

if you have an annual salary, this is as simple as dividing 181 billion (make sure you have 9 zeros!) by what you make a year (we can assume, like bezos, the taxes you have to pay, as well as your living expenses, are negligible)

for example, if you are lucky enough to make 6 figures a year, it would only take you a mere 
181000000000/100000= 1.8 million years of working to become a bezos.

if you make an hourly wage and get some overtime during the year, let us assume you have about 2000 working hours per year (as a usamerican).

you can now multiply your hourly wage by 2000 to get your taxless and expenseless (bezos) annual income. 

for example, let us say you make $10 an hour, a solid $2.75 above the federal fair labor standards act minimum wage. that would put you at 20,000 annual bezos dollars. 
 
for you, it will take a little longer than our 6 figure friend above, at:
181000000000/20000= 9 million years to become a bezos! 
in other words, you would have needed to start working around the time when chimpanzees and gorillas were evolving into different species during the late miocene period. better work harder!

thank you for taking the time to participate in the bezos project.

please now take the time to consider my questions;

who decides what is normal?

and

will this exercise lead to a behavioral change for you?

so... how many bezos years are you?

p.s.
just for fun, i ran the math for the highest ever paid female athlete in history, naomi osaka, who made 37.4 million last year. it would only take ms. osaka 4839 and a half years of dominating tennis to become a bezos!",0.9906

in general, this leads to a question i've been asking myself - isn't an environmentally friendly company a sort of oxymoron? if somebody really wants to make phone usage more sustainable, wouldn't it make more sense to campaign for and encourage purchasing used phones, instead of making a new one? wouldn't a truly environmentally friendly manufacturer just... not manufacture anything? of course, there are limits to this, if every manufacturer told you to buy used phones, soon there wouldn't be any used phones left as the supply of new phones to be used and resold would dry up, but in the current climate, with dozens of manufacturers making hundreds of thousands of phones, how is it good for the environment to add to that number?",0.9745

1,"animals, nature and cowardice **cowardice**

cowardice. it's an ugly word, a word nobody wants to be branded with. and branded is an appropriate term given the consequences of being labelled a coward in traditional society. it carries connotations of meekness, fear, emasculation and a loss of honour and pride; a coward forfeited his status as a man of the tribe. throughout history cowardice has been dealt with as if a serious crime, in the best case scenario men would be excommunicated and ostracised, in the worst case they would be executed. to drop your shield in battle and turn heels was the ultimate act of shame, to abandon your duty to your family and people was to abandon your manhood and your right to exist amongst your people. 

but what is cowardice? some people would claim that cowardice is an emotion, a state of mind that we have no more control over than we have control over our capacity to love, hate or fear. i disagree with that sentiment. cowardice isn't an emotion, it's a response to an emotion; a choice. it's a choice to buckle in the face of fear, a choice to follow the path of least resistance. it's a conscious effort to avoid pain, failure, struggle and duty. cowardice is the antithesis to courage and virtue and everything that traditional society held in reverence. cowardice, ultimately, is self serving and anti-natural. we have two choices when faced with the enormity and might of nature; we can run and hide or we can roll with the punches. when we choose to run and hide we sever our ties with the interconnectedness of life, we attempt to operate outside of its constraints and ultimately we lose what it means to be human. 

**globalism & the abuse of nature**

if we accept that cowardice is the choice of following the path of least resistance then we must view the globalist technological society as a society built on the foundations of cowardice. globalism, technological progress and the chasing of economic growth are responses to the fear of being defeated by nature. the building of cities dominated by steel and glass, automation and motorised transport plays a symbolic role in our psyche. it represents a fortress that we have built to keep nature out, it's a testament to our human arrogance of viewing ourselves as existing outside of nature, of wielding power and grabbing mother nature by the horns. so much so that technological society isn't content with merely escaping nature and its constraints, it wants to transcend nature. transgenderism, transhumanism, genetic modification of humans, plants and animals and the bastardisation of nations are all the result of a cowardly refusal to accept the reality of life. 

the importation of the entire world into overdeveloped cities is an unavoidable result of our escape from nature. in order to support ourselves outside of a natural life, a life that we evolved to exist within, we must create a machine capable of sustaining that anti-natural existence. that machine requires automation, it requires submissive slaves and it requires space, lots of space. a concrete city cannot sustain itself through hunting nor can it rely upon familial bond and duty, it must exploit and destroy if it wishes to survive. there are no wild fruit trees, no vegetables and no wild game in the city so it necessitates the building of a large scale agricultural machine. an agricultural machine that decimates native fauna and flora and one that outsources labour and decimates the native fauna and flora of foreign lands. nowhere is safe from the ruinous, creeping tendrils of globalism and technological advancement. 

**overpopulation, animals & feeble man**

continuous economic growth is both the result of and precursor to massive overpopulation. continuous economic growth is no longer a means to an end, it has become the end because it is the only way for man to escape the often times brutal and unrelenting natural world. it is cowardice that drives us further into the bowels of technological society and it is cowardice that keeps us there. modern man has become so impotent by design that he is no longer able to clothe himself or feed and provide shelter for his family, he instead mindlessly consumes commodities that are churned out by the system without consideration for any wider implications. he no longer exists as an organic entity, he is entrapped within the very fortress that he himself built for the sake of an easy life. 

what is the price to be paid for an easy life? great swathes of forest are levelled to the ground and replaced with saplings barely knee high, or fields of wheat doused in pesticide and fertiliser, or factories, mills and slaughterhouses. biodiversity is disregarded to make way for large quantities of potatoes and cereal to feed an ever growing number of mouths. millions of animals are reared in unsanitary conditions waiting to be slaughtered or used for their milk or fur. pigs that have lost the use of their back legs are beaten and kicked by unthinking drones to feed our children. chickens are wedged into sandwich crates covered in their own urine and feces and driven into slaughterhouses where the smell of death is thick and cloying in the air. a miserable, unnatural and pitiful existence totally antithetical to the essential turnings of life. for what cause? to serve the bellies of an unthinking, cowardly mass too afraid to confront their own state as a part of the web of life. 

children in the modern world have never had to hunt or fish, never had to skin and prepare an animal, never been taught how to respect life and the part that we all play in it. a child nowadays doesn't understand the circle of life or the importance of protecting it with the fierceness that we protect our own families with. take a child into the woods and ask him to identify this or that plant and they'll ask you were the aux input is. ask a child if he knows how bread is made. ask a child if he knows where his chicken nuggets come from and i can guarantee you that he is blissfully unaware of the horrors of unsanitary slaughterhouses. we shield children from the reality of where their food comes from because we know as matter of instinct that it is shameful and anti-natural. we would suffer no such shame teaching our children to forage or fish or hunt for their own food; and if we did then that speaks to the sorry state of affairs that we find ourselves in. 

humanity has strayed so far from its humble origins of synergistic existence that being confronted with that reality conflicts us with a great deal of cognitive dissonance. and so we revert to form, we take the cowardly option and avert our eyes, put our fingers in our ears and keep on banging the anvil. 

**conclusion**

cowardice used to be the epitome of shame and dishonour, it was shunned and discouraged because it was understood that cowardice lead to a life completely devoid of virtue and meaning. without struggle and hardship a people will never learn its own worth or be inclined to fight for its own existence. life isn't easy or unconstrained, it isn't without sadness or pain and resorting to cowardice rarely changes that fact, it merely shifts the burden. while you may no longer have to expend energy both physical and emotional to find food or shelter, you most certainly will struggle to find meaning in life or connection with your people. you may well be able to self administer a shot of dopamine through porn or substance abuse but you will be hard pushed to feel a primal connection with your land and it's beautiful history. 

this disconnection from the essence of what it means to be alive – hardship, achievement, self sustenance, reverence for your homeland – is the direct result of a global society. the world simply cannot sustain a large, ever growing global society. humans did not evolve in a global community. we did at one time exist in small, high trust, self sustaining communities. the populations of these communities were regulated by the abundance, or lack thereof, of raw materials. if materials were scarce then the population remained small by necessity, it was economical with its resources. protecting the environment wasn't a political tool or an inconvenience, it was vital to survival. times were hard and life had many challenges but comradery and kinship amongst your folk reached a spiritual level. something that is alien to modern man. to live was to be courageous, virtuous, bold; sitting at home twiddling your thumbs waiting for the microwave to ding was not an option. 

contrast this way of life – where cowardice meant death or dishonour – with the modern world. cowardice has become the default position because there is incentive for that to be so. all you have to do is tow the line, clock into work or sign on at the job centre and everything that our ancestors had to work tirelessly for is offered up to you on a plate. but at what cost? are you happy? we have become cattle whose sole purpose is to perpetuate the ever grinding march of progress and economic growth. small pockets of people still exist who live in harmony with the natural world but for how much longer? the day when the great maw of globalism finally swallows them up and builds a metropolis on the last remaining villages creeps ever closer. nowhere is safe. cowardice did this.",-0.996

1,"advice needed on promoting an environmental song on youtube a couple of years ago i wrote a song and asked people from all over the world to sing it. after that i made a video and asked the copyright owners for permission to include the fragments i had used. practically everyone was enthousiastic and happy to contribute, including some international charities, reaffirming my faith in humanity. there were some disappointments though. i had used about 4 seconds from the bbc's 'planet earth' for example and since this footage was vital to the 'story' in my video i must have written and called ten different departments within their organisation to ask permission. all of them told me the same thing. they would only provide the clip against a hefty sum   of money. since i did not want to spend/earn one cent with this project i ended up spending days trying to find a fragment to replace it with. i then encountered the same policy with cnn and a few other organisations that pretend to care about our planet, but care about money more. funny enough, this was all in line with the message of the song: if we want change we should not wait for companies/governements. we need to come together and force it ourselves. 

anyway, after finally finding some powerful footage to fill the empty spot i shared the song on facebook and with the help of the people that had contributed to it it ended up getting quite a bit of exposure. it was shared about 4500 times and received a lot of positive feedback. i like to believe it pushed a few people in the right direction.

meanwhile greta thunberg was doing the same thing on an infinitely bigger scale. i continued doing my small part making memes and having endless discussions online and offline about sustainability.

i felt things started to look promising for the movement and then covid came along. all of a sudden we cared about nothing else than the virus and are polluting the planet at a record breaking pace.

i have to admit i myself was kind of distracted by it as well, after it took my job (musician) and i had to find something else to bring food to the table. anyway, after having found another source of income i would like to focus on sustainability again and figured i might as well try to spread the song a little further. it is totally stuck on youtube though and i have no idea on how to get it moving there. if anyone could help me out i would greatly appreciate it. it is called 'drops of rain' by the way. if you search this on facebook you will surely find it. on youtube you probably won't . :)

i mean they all know about the amounts of plastic in the oceans, the problem with the current amount of emitted greenhouse gases and so on. the problem is just not particularly tangible. so they don’t seem to care. (it’s not that they burn the woods and throw radioactive waste in the rivers but there is just little consideration of waste reduction when buying groceries)

the idea would be to create a website that will make you change your reflection on consumption and propose you to buy only the product you really need and you are looking for.
for example i want to buy a shirt and i don't know anything about sustainability or slow fashion. i go on this special website because i know that at the end i will have a sustainable shirt.
i just arrive on the page and say that i need a shirt. then, instead of arriving on a full page of clothes, the website ask me a simple question like ""do you really need it ?""
i answer and the website tells me ""do you already have one?"". 
i answer again and the website says ""ok maybe you can check second hands shops that may have what you need"" and makes me fulfill some details about size, colours.. and make a selection of second hand shirts.
i don't want to buy second hand so i can chose to go for a new product. the website makes a selection of the available ethical shirt on the page without any other products or advertising. 
at the end i have what i was looking for, i learned some information one the way and some questions that i will ask myself next time when i would ne d to buy something.

for me by changing the logic behind the consumption we will make the difference. and so by proposing only one product for a research on a website, we will make people buy less products maybe?
just tell me if that makes sense for you, it is just an idea i had and i wanted people to debate on that idea.",0.9722

1,"why you need impact startup **7 reasons why creation of even small impact startup is the best exercise for your development**

1. you’ve spent a lot of money and time on “self-awareness” training? how about the results? what if i told you there is another, maybe less daunting way which supports self-development? launching a startup immediately reveals who you are in all your glory (or quite an opposite). it shows all your weaknesses and deficits – lack of essential hard and soft skills. it is the best test to understand how much you can offer to others. no mindfulness training will be able to deprive you from illusions in such a short time as a startup will do. it will open a box with your most horrible scares. but it’s the only way to grow. development it’s not about following your dream but mostly getting rid of internal fears. 

2. do you suffer from procrastination, lack of purpose in life, low motivation, self-pity, uncertainty and lack of confidence? business will make you fanatically focused. even the smallest tiny impact startup will swallow all your time and attention. as someone once said: when i’ve started my business, i slept at nights as a baby – waked up every three hours and cried. 

3. you feel lonely, all by yourself? people don’t understand you and you don’t have real friends? impact startup will teach you how to understand people because you should be able to recognize customers, partners and potential employees. you will have to learn how to feel people’s desires, and what they actually want. it will improve your communications skills and will save you from numerous misunderstandings in the future. 

4. impact startup will take time initially reserved in your schedule for social talks, favorite tv serials, social networks, meditation and spiritual practices. but at the same time, it will give energy and determination. it will teach you how to learn and work 10 times faster than you used to. impact startup will teach you how to deal with problems and how to see possibilities instead of obstacles. how to overcome circumstances and get what you want. you will forget the word “impossible”. it will teach you not to spare yourself, stop complaining, become more productive. you will understand that stability is a lack of opportunities. you will start to respect yourself.

5. impact startup will teach you how to earn money, when income depends on your personal efforts, and there are no restrictions. many people consider entrepreneurs greedy. in reality everything is the opposite. most of the hired people are greedy because income is limited and they have to stay in budget, save money and forget about the wishes. in other words: always limit themselves. 

6. money from your startup will give you various opportunities to help others. the more successful you become, the more people can benefit from it. money is absolutely necessary resource if you want to change the world. impact startup will teach you how to handle money, treat them not as a goal, but as a means for common goods. at least, if you hate money, the more you earn, the more you can burn. 

7. and the last thing. most of the hired positions are limited with age and skills criteria. impact startup is always open to you. you can start it tomorrow, even today. it gives you unlimited growth, makes you the master of life, open up the whole world. you will be able to create something which you will pass to your children. just think about it.

i'm a big outdoors person, minored in sustainable design in undergrad, enjoy science, did my masters thesis on ecological design, and currently have lost passion for my current job and am eyeing the end of summer to quit. emotions may be intensified by the global pandemic but i've been begging to feel this way for a while.

tl;dr i want to innovate and be a part of the green/sustainable revolution (even if it is a slow one) and environmental design. i'm looking for tips/specific jobs in the field that can help lead me down this path/specialization in architecture.

any advice, career, life, etc. is much appreciated!!! thanks for reading! hope everyone is doing ok",0.9855

this is what i’m worried about; the current trend in the life science industry, since the emergence of medicine as an industry, has been 

small molecule drugs —> macromolecular products (proteins, nucleic acids) —-> genetic manipulation (current uprising). 

i’m afraid that only after the genetic era, will there be a frantic shift towards eco centric research, which imo will be too late at that point. i understand that funding is virtually non existent for environmental related research but doesn’t there have to be some sort of wake up call in the next decade or so that if we don’t get our shit together we’re screwed?",-0.9445

1,"thinking about sustainability-related master's in new zealand – good idea? i just graduated from a university in the united states with a bachelor's in political science and minors in history and sustainability studies. although i’ve lived in the us my whole life, i also have hereditary united kingdom and new zealand citizenship.

i originally planned to spend a couple of years working either in the us or abroad before worrying about getting a higher degree, but covid-19 and the current state of the job market have made this untenable. now, i’m thinking that if i can’t find full-time employment, it might be best to go ahead for a master’s. and by far the most affordable option would be to do it in new zealand (i’m aware that studying in new zealand means that i'd probably be ""stuck"" in the country as far as careers go, and that’s a prospect i’m definitely fine with).

the main dilemma is that postgraduate degrees are highly specialized, whereas i’m a generalist excited about anything relating to politics, society, and the social sciences. but sustainability and environmental issues are likely what i am most interested in and where i would like to spend my career.

i’ve been researching potential degrees (including those along the lines of environmental studies, sustainable business, and climate change science and policy) and careers (i.e. public agencies, nonprofits, and private-sector sustainability), but this has just made me more indecisive.

the most important thing for me is that i’m doing something which i enjoy and which i believe has a positive societal impact. but after that, career prospects are my top priority. i went through my undergraduate with no strategy besides just taking courses that seemed interesting, and even though i went to a prestigious university and made good grades, this has rendered me unemployable. i’m desperate to avoid making the same mistake again.

i’ve heard lots of contradictory pieces of advice, but the general impression i’ve gotten is most green jobs are in hard sciences and engineering, whereas the more generalized, less stem-focused jobs are relatively rare and extremely competitive. this has honestly made me feel pretty lost and worried about whether this whole idea is a dead end.

this is obviously a major decision, so i don’t expect to get all the answers from reddit. but if anyone is able to offer relevant insight, advice, experience, or resources for finding more information – either about whether this is a good idea in general, about sub-disciplines i should look into, or about specific universities/programs – it would definitely be appreciated.",0.9932

1,"worried about my future i am an airplane pilot currently out of work due to tourism essentially being nonexistent at the moment for reasons i don't really need to explain. i am worried i won't find work at all this summer season, which is my primary income period, and therefore regress in skill and knowledge from not flying for a long time. i already haven't being flying since november 2019 because of winter (i live in canada).

having all this free time has allowed me to examine what is important to me, who i want to be, my personal morals, interests, etc.

i love my work. i am primarily a float plane pilot. it is extremely fun, challenging, and rewarding work for me personally, but i do have problems with it...

airplane travel is not good for the planet. it uses incredible amounts of fuel and is one of the largest contributors to global emissions.

i have been considering changing careers because i am having a hard time coming to terms with working in an unsustainable, polluting industry. while i don't fly huge jets or fly rich people around in their private jets which are much worse contributors, the airplanes i fly are still ""dirty"" and still burn a lot of fuel.

that said...

there is one company near my neck of the woods who in december 2019 had the first test flight of their in development, all electric converted dhc-2 beaver float plane. this company has future plans to convert their entire fleet of aircraft to all electric if it goes well with their first prototype. their operations would allow them to transition to electric because their airplanes typically do several short hop flights then return to base. electric airplanes have a highly reduced flight time, and therefore range, than fuel counterparts because batteries are very heavy and the energy density is much, much lower than fuel. so my guestimation is their airplanes would have around 1.5 hours of flight time. this company is currently also carbon neutral by (i think?) contributing to recycling companies or something like that.

this had me really excited because i thought ""wow. i'd be able to keep doing what i love and feel good about it, if i worked for them."" this is the only company i am aware of that is doing this, though.

realistically this is a long way out, provided their plans work as intended. so this disheartened me.

i'm in a personal battle between wanting to keep doing what i love, and being a more mindful, sustainable person not only in everyday life but with my occupation. honestly, it's hard for me to understand why more people, especially those with families, kids, grandkids are not sort of freaking out about where the planet is heading and what it means for our descendants. the future of our species is being decided by us, now. what we, as humans, do over the next few decades either means a very difficult and ugly, or prosperous life for our families and theirs. i don't even have a family of my own and it greatly concerns me.

while in this battle i'd love to hear some suggestions for some environmentally sustainable careers i may be able to use the skills i've attained as a pilot to transition to more easily... or some good resources for researching this.

thanks!",0.9563

- sustainable energy ( solar) the power for every family or individual to power their everyday needs, and those days sun power can not be met there is always the grid to turn to.
- evs whether singular (cars) or massive (buses): being capable to get from point a to b relying on a friendly environment machine. that can be powered by ourselves or by the grid.
- internet connectivity worldwide, (satellites) bringing the whole world connected, at a cheap accesible price. (there are still rural areas or countries where internet is a luxury, not mentioning the speed of will be capable of reaching)
-safe space travel (and even more in the distant future or maybe not so distant, space colonies, mars or on the moon)
- the advancement of everyday technologies like smartphones, ai, smart homes, etc.
- medicine that keeps improving, and implementing tech into its uses and applications.

it's my belief that fairness and greater equality should be front-of-mind when considering how to address climate change.

there are many people throughout the world who haven’t achieved what we would class as basic living standards – access to energy, food, sanitation, and so on. their consumption over the coming decades will need to increase – dramatically, in some cases – to enjoy a better quality of life.

as a global community, we need to find innovative ways of meeting these demands with solutions that do the least harm to people and the planet.

at the same time, in developed countries, there is a need to curb many forms of consumption. this could mean regulation, restriction or prohibition of things we enjoy and are used to. air travel, for instance, may need to be rationed. car engines over a certain litre might be banned. certain consumer goods may cease to exist because a harmful chemical process which is essential to their production is outlawed.

these changes won’t be easy to stomach, especially when something is banned which *you* enjoy, so there are two essential components. firstly, all attempts to curb consumption must be transparent and universal. people must truly believe that we’re all in this together, and that no amount of wealth or power can place you above the rules.

1,"could thinking sustainability be as simple as asking yourself, 'would everyone be able to do this without the planet falling apart?' i often ask myself this question: “could the thing i want to do be done by all people across the world and still be sustainable for the planet?”

it's my belief that fairness and greater equality should be front-of-mind when considering how to address climate change. 

there are many people throughout the world who haven’t achieved what we would class as basic living standards – access to energy, food, sanitation, and so on. their consumption over the coming decades will need to increase – dramatically, in some cases – to enjoy a better quality of life.

as a global community, we need to find innovative ways of meeting these demands with solutions that do the least harm to people and the planet.

at the same time, in developed countries, there is a need to curb many forms of consumption. this could mean regulation, restriction or prohibition of things we enjoy and are used to. air travel, for instance, may need to be rationed. car engines over a certain litre might be banned. certain consumer goods may cease to exist because a harmful chemical process which is essential to their production is outlawed. 

these changes won’t be easy to stomach, especially when something is banned which *you* enjoy, so there are two essential components. firstly, all attempts to curb consumption must be transparent and universal. people must truly believe that we’re all in this together, and that no amount of wealth or power can place you above the rules. 

the second component is placing consumption and its consequences at the heart of the education system. teaching subjects like science or geography around the basis of products children actually consume, with the goal of helping them understand the need for regulation in order to protect their futures and the future of the planet.

it’s my hope that, over time, we reach an equilibrium. where everyone on the planet can enjoy a good quality of life, whilst also keeping within the sustainable limits of our planet.

i am writing my thesis regarding the sustainability and the automotive industry.

i came upon the concept of domestic processed outputs - which according to the authors of the article that i read is defined as:

*""which represents the total mass of materials which have been used in the national economy, before flowing into the environment. these flows occur at the processing, manufacturing, use, and final disposal stages of the economic production-consumption chain.""*

now, i not quite sure, carrying out an lca of an electric vehicle. if the throughout the whole process, generating electricity and dismantling the vehicle at the end of the life, would the co2, pm, so2, nickel, copper and so on, be consider as dpo?

i am totally confused on this point. please help me :)

1,"case studies is companies leveraging sustainability as a competitive advantage hi all,

i'm working on a project with some fellow sustainability advocates which focuses around building a narrative for why companies should incorporate authentic sustainability into their strategies.  the benefits to the environment are clear.  where we are starting to stall a little bit is in finding concrete examples of how businesses have benefited financially from sustainable investments.  note: we do not think that finances are the most important aspect of a company's operations, but are being realistic that there people in corporate positions of power that disagree.  therefore, we want concrete examples that show them that sustainability is not only about sacrificing profits to appease hippies.

for example, tesla is the easy case study.  they drew a clear line in the sand that they would only build electric vehicles, then took that a step farther by incorporating solar energy and energy storage into their business model.  this has resulted in a ton of advantages ranging from brand prestige/equity to revenue from selling co2/zev credits etc. etc.

i'm asking for this community's help in discussing/sharing other examples of companies (or towns or countries or any other entity really) that have done the right thing from a sustainability perspective, then been rewarded by the market for it.

looking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts!  thank you so much.",0.9896

first off, to bake sourdough the oven (\~15 yr old electric) needs to be at \~500 degrees f for about 2 hours (preheat dutch oven and baking two loaves separately). i do this about once a week. i also use half a five pound bag of bread flour (kaf) to make two loafs, but the oven time and temp is more of my concern. 

in a bakery, they bake multiple loaves in their oven and their flour is most likely more locally sourced and in bulk. i could walk there and get a loaf in my own container (so no waste). so am i wrong for seeing it as a more environmentally friendly option than baking it at home or is this really trivial?",0.4503

\-agriculture- the current global system of agriculture is relatively poor. the whole life cycle of  food system creates an incredibly large amount of precious wasted food. small companies like choco are stepping in and making the food system more sustainable by connecting local chefs with local farmers.

originally a couple of us met and realized we had the same idea for sustainable communal living, then we kept chatting and finding other people with similar visions but we were quite caught up with life to focus on the project. now, because of circumstances, we're quite free to pursue this idea. 

the project:

the ecovillage movement is nothing new but efforts towards sustainable living en masse seem to be quite disjointed and independent one from the other. we want to aid the acceleration of this standard of living by creating a ""plug and play"" sort of model for empowerment of individuals that are struggling under the current system (i.e. disenfranchised minorities, neglected rural communities, the troubled youth). this model would consist of a hyperledger that functions as both a library of resources for housing, plant growth, self-governance, and a means of establishing a living network of interconnectivity that allows members to be recognized and validated globally by the net.

right now we are creating the initial documentation and planification for a practical pilot project, and we invite anybody who's interested in this kind of endeavour to approach us; whether to collaborate, or just talk about the idea. we have plenty of resources on the matter that we would love to share and expand on. 

feel free to contact me!

our product allows government/business to easily switch from using paper processes to emailing directly from their sap erp systems. research has shown that switching from paper to email saves 20g of carbon per email and many of these businesses are sending millions of emails a month. 

think of your utility company allowing you to opt in to get an email invoice at the end of the month instead of sending you print invoice. 

each time this happens 20g of carbon are saved and there is a record of it in our software product.  

any feedback welcome.

(for people that are not in quarantine) i have some ideals like carry our own utensils in our bag and bring them to work (school) place and restaurant even if they provide. since we don't really know if they clean those utensils thoroughly, bringing our own utensils not only make sure it is safe, but also sustainable if we eat take outs. another ideal i have is for face mask. since medical mask is a more of a disposable item, it really adds up if we use them every day. few days ago, taiwan's food and drug administration posted how we can use rice cooker to sterilize it, making it to be used 3 or 5 times more.

1,"creating intentional communities focused on sustainability whatsup internet,

my name u/ultisquatter and i have an idea that i want to share. 

my goals in life are pretty simple. make the world a better place, have fun and enjoy my life, help us create a sustainable society. 

one of the ways the i want to do that is by building sustainable buildings and ultimately, communities. 

groups of people can work together more effectively to meet their needs. costs are subsidized and standard of living can increase without more expenses. the ideas aren't revolutionary, and the creation of an intentional community has been done many times before ... i just want to try making one myself. 

i have a background in construction and a good sense of what's possible with easily accessible construction materials. i'm confident i could take an existing building and, without too much extra money, turn it into a pretty sweet micro community. 

if we get the right group of people (8-12), we could create a space that offers both individual privacy as well as shared amenities. 

i figure right now is the perfect time to do this since everyone just lost their jobs and cost cutting might become a bit more relevant in the future.

\-movie time: get snacks bean bags and play a documentary

those types of things

    these facts, along with the south atlantic anomaly, another sign something is not right with earth's magnetic field. this field shields us from the majority of the sun's many types of radiation. last summer, for the first time in my life, personally got a sunspot. it turned grey and fell off after a year but there's still a dark spot there. the dr. told me, ""it's from the sun, it's a benign skin cancer"". so, please protect your skin. i watch a yt channel everyday at 830am est. it's called suspicious observers. you don't have to buy into their electromagnetic pole flip theory, the 3 minute videos tell you what'd happened on the sun in the last 24 hours. if elon musk had watched he would never have lost 40 satellites. yes he's launched in solar wind conditions 10x worse, but the earth's em field is off kilter and not working the way it used to, i believe it is the earth's natural response to the holocene extinction. i mean, from mother earth's point of view, she's reached an ele. whether it happens overnight or 100,000 years, it's all the same to her. be safe, pay attention to the effect the sun has on earth's climate, earthquakes, volcanoes, and ocean currents. be safe, everyone.",0.9678

 the sun's many different types of radiation will be nowhere near as helpful as they are if it continues to weaken. we seen the evidence of this not too long ago. when elon musk lost like 40 satellites of 49 in conditions they've launched in ten times worse and had zero problems. that's because these were small probably 2 kilo free internet satellites he's putting up to offer free internet to 3rd world countries and the impoverished. i like his 'swartz-esque' stance here that knowledge shouldn't come with a price tag. what if the cure for cancer comes from one of those forgotten 3rd world kids that will now have the ability to learn from the stores of knowledge on the internet. but i digress, the solar wins was mild that day.  elon's people should be aware of a yt channel i watch everyday because i believe this will happen before 2050. if the earths magnetic field doesn't pick back up, skin cancers will go through the roof. maybe not this summer, .sybe not next. but in 5-10 years the reality is you will need solar radiation protection. especially if you want kids. nobody ever discusses the damage already done in conjunction with the earth's natural response to the conditions we created are already causing deaths. when they get to be weekly massive scare events you'll know somethings so wrong, it's beyond repair. unless our governments look at the evidence and make massive changes like ten years ago, we have a shelf life here on earth and we don't know if we're capable of surviving on another planet or moon colony. the politicians and people tryong to get the most toys before they die need to do something or we will destroy our homeplanet, make it uninhabitable to human life. sadly, the holocene extinction is real...",-0.967
0,"syria has a water crisis. and it’s not going away.   

when the syrian uprising began in 2011, water was an important factor in sparking the revolt because the drought exacerbated the existing socio-economic distress. since the conflict began, it has proved catastrophic for syrian water resources; damaged infrastructure left entire regions without irrigation, drinking water, and hydro-electric power, rendering them increasingly vulnerable to seismic activity.

the expansion of kurdish forces in northern syria brought the three biggest syrian dams under the control of the kurdish-led autonomous administration of north and east syria. this prompted the intervention of turkey and its de facto occupation of parts of the border region, while the syrian government recovered control of the southern part of the euphrates basin. ever since, syrian and turkish officials and northeastern syria region officials have continued to exchange accusations of disruption to water services.

the combination of climate change, domestic mismanagement, competition, and regional conflict has brought the water issue to the top of the local and regional actor’s political agenda. when the euphrates river became a political border between warring factions, water scarcity turned into a key regional security issue.",-0.9674

\- california from the economical and work perspective is good. heat waves, wildfires, earthquakes -> no go 

\- pacific northwest (let it be the usa or ca) is on our shortlist, but then that heat wave last summer, like 50 degrees c, whaaaat...? if that is becoming the new norm, i guess wildfires will be more prevalent and in an area with so many forests and wooden housing that sounds like a deadly future.

\- northeast: albeit many historical cities in the us, somehow we are not in love with that part of the country and in canada that's the french speaking region which is also a no go.

now, scientists warn the internal temperature of the core of earth has decreased 0.5 degrees since the pre-geothermic age.   they warn that decreasing the core temperature further slows fission reactions causing a run-away effect, eventually causing the core to become solid and no longer molten.   volcanic activity has markedly decreased, and almost all natural hot springs have already dried up in recent years.

the biggest threat they warn:  continued cooling of the core could destabilize the earth's magnetic field leaving us vulnerable to cosmic rays, and eventually stripping the earth of the atmosphere.

what can we do?   we are helpless.   there is no way to convince anyone to stop lunar travel as there are a bunch of sports that can only be played there in lunar gravity.   those in the 1% own properties on titan and many celestial bodies that require several millions of times the energy consumption of the average citizen to maintain.  the few saying we need to stop sucking so much energy from underground are suppressed by waves of counter-propaganda.  the economy can't take it.

0,"? effect of carbon dioxide emissions by altitude ? hi!

i'm doing some very simplified calculations right now and i'm looking for a chart or table that shows the approximate effect of carbon dioxide emissions by altitude. 

does anyone have a chart or table that's structured somewhat like this:

0 amsl: 1x
2'000 amsl: 1.2x
5'000 amsl: 2x
10'000 amsl: 5x
(arbitrary numbers for the sake of the example)

0,"climate change became more corporate advertising and political manipulation then an actual concern. everyone's talking climate change nowadays, it's in the news, the governments, people's minds and everywhere

my problem is with the solutions to this massive issue.

we have paper straws wrapped in plastic and they call that packaging environmentally friendly, like seriously?

no ones thinking about the large scale issues that really cause climate change. 

advertising - useless lights used all night long to illuminate an ad or a company's logo - this is a massive waste of power and should be forbidden, all billboards should not be illuminated and no business building should have lights on over the night illuminating some logo. if no one's working there then turn off the lights.

factories - use mostly old and inefficient equipment, produce toxic waste that in too many parts of the world is just dumped in the wild

farms - animal farms pollute with animal waste, including poop, pee and body parts of the slaughtered animals that make the ground toxic

data centers - use massive amounts of power, they're everywhere and a lot of them use old equipment, like older more power hungry processors, they also use massive amounts of power for cooling and too few data centers use the weather (when possible) to cool the equipments, like in the winter. they just have those hvacs on full blast, not to mention many dc's use old and inefficient hvacs due to the cost of upgrading them

power generation - although in the process of phasing out, most fossil fuels plants are terribly inefficient (under 25% eff in heat to power generation), and when they are phased out they aren't replaced with better alternatives like nuclear or solar. due to the cost of power storage solar isn't economically viable by itself and it requires having some sort of normal power plant. then just built fucking nuclear, but no, everyone's against it these days due to radiation risks, nuclear weapons and the explosion risks. there isn't a government push to inform the paople that the current nuclear plant technologies are much safer and have a lot lower risks. they also don't make the push towards decentralisation of power generation

oil industry - besides polluting massively when extracting, they do so when processing oil into fuel and plastics and there isn't enough push globally towards electrical transportation. electric cars are one thing but complicated due to the batteries, but then you have the good ol' train that doesn't require traction batteries, even so too much of the world doesn't care about them

cargo transportation - ships are okay, reasonable efficiency and too hard to make electric without a nuclear reactor anyway, the plane is also acceptable when speed is needed, rail transport is the best but poorly managed and then there's trucking that's horribly inefficient in fuel consumption. road transport is inefficient by design, the tire being a big problem here, but, if better managed the train can replace medium and long haul trucking and air cargo. just make different types of freight trains that can go fast with less cargo or slower with more, upgrade the rail to support all the new traffic and were set. even shipping from china to europe could be replaced with train if there'd be international cooperation to make a nice and strong railway across russia and adjacent countries.

deforestation - everyone knows about this one. and here i say this. housing can be made from recycled trash, used plastic, and has been made, but it isn't profitable enough even so, it's a great idea to make houses this way.

passenger cars - although batteries pose a problem the more fundamental problem is that were looking to have electric cars on existing infrastructure, due to cost. well i say fuck that, wirelessly powered cars are inefficient in their own right, but why not make them anyway? you'll need a lot less battery in a given car and even if inefficient you more the problem to compensate for that in power generation that if nuclear, wind and solar could mean nothing to the climate. nuclear pollution is far easier to deal with compared to burning a lot of fuel. who cares if you waste power if generating that power doesn't add additional pollution (more or less, let's say nuclear waste doesn't add up here) 


the biggest problem in my eyes if that everyone wants climate change but no one implements it if it's not profitable, i'm here to say that not everything needs to be profitable, some investments must be made for the greater good of everyone. maybe my ideas aren't good, i'm sure there are better, but even so it needs to be done even at a loss. there's a reason i pay taxes to my country, that reason is to pay for everything needed to assure living is good for everyone, including myself, that we have access to clean air, water and infrastructure. you don't need to make a direct profit from a thing, just pay for it with my tax money. there are other kinds of profit beyond numbers show.

taking the blame on the consumer for the incompetence of the governments to solve the large scale issues is idiotic. there are things consumers, average people can do, yes, but the core problem is the larger scale, like what i've stated here. eliminate those and what consumers do is mostly of no consequence.",-0.966

this so far seems accurate as i am not connected to the power grid or any utilities, and i don't ride in cars, planes, buses or anything with an engine in it.  i catch rain, compost my poo, cook using solar oven and wood.

the problem is, they claim for $4 a month i can completely offset this 2.9 ton of emissions.   this is obviously a lie/scam/fake.  if it were true we could offset all of america (more than 6x my emissions on average) for 100 billion a year.   if it were really this cheap we could really afford to simply offset the entire world and be done with the whole issue.

so,  why are they allowed to lie/scam people and take their money while not actually burying carbon in a stable form?    why do they not calculate the emissions of refining, and transporting the fuels and all the energy used to produce an aircraft such as exotic super alloys in the engine.   all the emissions of all the people who work at airports (could be eliminated) as well as everything involved with that.

   they only consider the emissions it burns in that one flight, don't consider the effects of releasing it at high altitude, and in the end offer ""offsets"" by selling co2 to greenhouses or  planting trees that will eventually (or maybe next year even) burn down in uncontrollable forest fires.

0,"the current faces of denial: deception, deflection and defeatism. while people who outright deny climate change do certainly still exist, they are now in the minority. the majority now recognises the simple fact that climate change is a real and present threat to humanity, and that it needs to be addressed.

as such the fossil fuel corporations, who have been spreading propaganda for years as i'm sure most of you already know, have been forced to move onto more insidious forms of denial.

1) deception:

deceiving people with greenwashing and fantasy technologies. we can see numerous infuriating examples of this, particularly in companies that use 'carbon capture' and geoengineering as excuses to continue burning destructive and finite fuel sources.

2) deflection:

transfering the blame onto others, when they are the core of the rot. the most well known form of this is the whole carbon footprint lie that major companies came up with to push individual, rather than collective, action. we can also see this with people who say things like ""why should my country lower emissions? it's india/china/russia/america/etc that are to blame!""

if we blame each other to excuse inaction, while ignoring the true people at the core of this catastrophe, we will never get anything done. we need unified action if we are to come out of this crisis, we cannot achieve that if we are shifting blame around endlessly.

3) defeatism:

this is not as common as the others, but it is perhaps the most insidious. in the face of increasingly disastrous climate change we can also observe an increase in doomism and fatalism within the environmental movement itself- something that is believed to be spurred, ironically enough, by the fossil fuel companies and their bots. even just looking around this subreddit and others like it you'll see people popping up in any discussion about climate actions or realistic solutions to preach about how 'it's already too late' or else that 'tipping points will wipe us out in a few years so it's pointless anyway'.

i empathise with this mentality because i've been there. and, unlike other forms of denial, there is some truth to it: it is too late to stop climate change and biodiversity loss, because it's already here and will continue to worsen in the near term even if we do everything right.

having said that this also ignores the fact that climate change is not a binary situation: it's not something that will or won't happen, it's already happened and now it's a matter of how much worse we let it get. if we fail to contain global warming to 2.0 degrees c then 2.5 is better than 3.6, which is better than 4.0, which is better than, 5.0 degrees, etc. how bad it gets is up to us as a global civilisation- and yes, that is including positive feedback loops. contrary to popular opinion most tipping points, as per our present understanding, function over an extended period of time- with some possible exponential shifts in the more extreme ones.

that is not to say that they aren't a massive threat, because they are. it is simply to say that they are long-term threats that lock in climate change for years even after we stop emitting, rather than instantaneous threats that will knock us into a day after tomorrow type scenario as soon as we trigger them. even if that was true it still wouldn't account for plastic waste, chemical pollution nor habitat destruction by the agricultural industry (particularly the beef industry) which are all purely human errors and can be stopped by humans.

**so, what can we do?**

first, we need the mental resilience not to give up in the face of an ever more dire situation. things are bad and they will likely get worse, we need to accept that so we can mitigate and adapt to it as it comes. we need a massive and unified movement to change our society for the better; that can only happen if we are willing to stand together in holding the rich suits who caused this mess and forced us into a consumerist system to account.

lifestyle changes are good and should be encouraged, but the best thing you can do is become part of the social shift we are presently seeing. volunteer with local conservation groups, join an activist organisation, go on strike, plant pollinator friendly plants, combat the various forms of denial when you see them, write to your representatives, vote on politicians based on actions rather than parties, try to rally your community in building resilience to climate change (establishing communal permaculture gardens, planting native trees, writing to the government enmasse, etc) and donate to trustworthy charities- if you can afford it.

on a societal level we need to focus on not just transitioning away from fossil fuels but also on cooling down the planet. enhancing natural carbon sinks, particularly ocean ones, through rewilding and most likely a degree of genetic modification is vital for this.

do not let people guilt trip you, do not let them lie to you about false-hope silver bullets and do not let them convince you that it is too late to do anything at all. the elites will brutalise our planet then profit off of our suffering if we let them; but humanity is capable of both horrific and wonderful things when we work together.",-0.853
0,"let's not create a self fulfilling prophecy. the amount of people who spend their time talking about how hopeless the climate crisis is or how anyone who thinks we won't be extinct within the next ten to twenty years is full of 'hopium' seems to be increasing. or at least, they are certainly not decreasing.

obviously part of this comes with the rise in climate anxiety and the general negative environment of the internet and media, but i feel that there is more to it than that.

especially when it comes to those who go out of their way to disparage action.

i've seen this so many times, people going around to videos and articles about the environmental crisis just to talk about how climate action is meaningless. they infiltrate any discussion about solutions to insult anyone who's working towards mitigating climate change; complaining about how 'we missed our chance twenty years ago and now nothing matters', telling people that there's no point in protesting against fossil fuels because of positive feedback loops, etc.

if you try talking to them about how there is an entire spectrum of scenarios outlined by scientists they'll claim that they're in on a conspiracy to cover it up. if you bring up how positive feedback loops cause only a fraction of the harm that human activities cause they'll tell you to look up bendall or mcpherson. they are about as reasonable as conventional deniers when it comes to this kind of thing.

while some of them are just severely depressed young people who are repeating what they've heard online, i do believe that there is something more sinister going on with it and i think we should probably talk about it.

 at the core of it these defeatist arguments use the same line of logic as deniers:

the belief that scientists are being dishonest, the belief that mainstream science cannot be trusted and the belief that fighting against pollution is pointless. denial and deflection worked exceedingly well against older generations and both were actively weaponised by fossil fuel companies. i suspect that this may be an attempt at demotivating younger people; who are more vulnerable to anxiety and depression.

let's not create a self-fulfilling prophecy, that is serving the interests of fossil fuel companies and corporations. let's focus on fighting even if we miss our targets, because every fraction of a degree makes a massive difference in how screwed we are. there is a wide spectrum of possible futures between utopia and annihilation.",-0.9981

0,"how should we go about cooling the planet? &#x200b;

obviously we need to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean energy, but we also need to undo the damage that we've done. even if we were to meet our emission targets, which almost certainly won't happen, we will still blow past 1.5 and most probably 2.0 degrees c- meaning we will need to interfere in order to combat positive feedback loops in the climate system.

enhancing carbon sinks through rewilding is one way that this can be done. we should be giving our primary focus to the oceans however, as they produce a majority of our oxygen. kelp forests, algae and phytoplankton all need to be bred and utilised to the fullest extent. though i'm sure many would be against it i also feel that genetic engineering will be necessary to give them a chance at adapting in time; given the rate of ocean acidification and the fact that 2.4 degrees is pretty much the best case scenario right now- with us more likely looking at an increase of 3.0 to 4.5 degrees at this point.

i also feel that some level of geoengineering will be utilised. this will end up happening whether we want it or not, seeing how governments and major corporations are currently preparing for it, so we need to make sure that the less horrendous forms of it get used. i'm against aerosol injections, but the use of large reflective surfaces (either mirrors or platforms covered in white paint) shows a good deal of promise. artificial clouds made from ocean mist, such as what they're using over the great barrier reef, also may be worthwhile.

when people discuss climate change, and the related threats to our planet's stability, it is often referred to as something binary; that we either stop completely or get wiped out by. however this is not supported by the scientific community, hence why groups like the ipcc and nasa refer to multiple scenarios.

we cannot stop climate change or biodiversity loss, because they are already here and will continue into the foreseeable future. we also likely will not succeed in capping global warming at 2 degrees c, let alone 1.5 c. what we can do, and what we can always do, is limit the inevitable damage.

even with tipping points and positive feedback loops the overwhelming majority of the harm still comes directly from human activities- and that is not likely to change much within this century. every fraction of a degree added is a catastrophe and every fraction we stop is a catastrophe averted.

if we fail to reach our climate targets we must still transition away from fossil fuels, reform our agricultural industry, electrify the grid and preserve/restore as much of the natural world as we can- especially the oceans. 2 degrees is better than 3, which is better than 4, which is better than 5, etc.

the longer we wait the more brutal the consequences will be and the more likely it becomes that dangerous solutions such as geo-engineering will be utilised, or that we will be too afflicted to enact them at all.

and don't listen to the people who say we have five or ten or twelve years left to 'fix' it, or we'll all die. that belief comes from bad reporting; scientists say we have only so many years to limit it to 2 degrees or less, not until the world becomes uninhabitable or civilisation collapses.",-0.9909

0,"can you change my mind? i am a sceptic on climate change. i am a sceptic because i like to question everything. one of the main reasons for questioning climate change was because the government in usa lied about weapons of mass destruction in afghanistan. since this time i have questions everything. 

when it comes to climate change the first lie is when they try to make it about the earths mean temperature changing. 99% of people believe that the climate changes over time otherwise you would not believe in warm periods or ice ages. their real question then is do you believe there predictions that the earth will warm up and we will all be dead in ten years.

the second lie is when they tell us that this is the hottest its ever been and we are breaking all new records. look up “outsider weather and ice age watch” on sky news australaia. in the middle ages it was hotter than now. we know this through looking at old data and the fact that during medieval times they used to grow grapes to make wine in england but dont anymore. 
its also been colder than before. during the industrial revolution there is paintings of people ice scateing on the thames in england. somewhere between the 60s and 90s they were warning of an ice age to scare the masses.

the third lie. they tell us to trust the scientists. the scientists results have changed over time since al gore first showed his graphs and forcasts.
 the way they come to there conclusion is very iffy. some scientists speak out against climate change not being real but are striped of funding later on. an example of this is polar bears numbers increasing but because it does not fit the narative these scientists are discredited. if you want to be a scientist and study something you will need most likely need a grant for funding. when applying for grants in the field of science you are much more likely to get a grant for studying something that will help credit climate change. if you have openly tried to discredit climate change in anyway they will not fund you at all.

the cult of climate change see anyone that disagrees with them as uneducated conspiracy theorists and they will not let anyone say anything against their theory. in reality science is a process of questioning over and over again. scientists used to believe that the earth was flat through rigourous experiments they proved this theory wrong. this cult will not let you question their beliefs so they operate more like a religion than science.

the amount scientists have changed their minds on thing being good and bad like coffee and wine is astounding. 
every year each country predicts the what the next years temperature is going to be. each year the results are way of and much lower that previously thought

the fourth lie is carbon dioxide. its is not our enemy. if you have 2 plants that are in similar condition but on has double the carbon dioxide, then the plant with double with grow better and stronger.

the earths atmosphere is also very complex and i do not believe that can predict the earths atmosphere correctly. they have not  factored in sunspots which are responsible for many ice ages and warm periods.

now that you are aware that there is a something wrong with climate change theory the next question is why and who would spin this story? 

i honesty believe that that its was started by rich people as a way to control us by making people fight for the climate rather than against them. rich people do not believe in it. al gore lives in a big house and uses over 3 times more carbon emissions than the average usa family. lots of rich people are the ones that fly around the world and use the most carbon emissions. they also live in beach side properties and do not look like they are selling any time soon.

water vapour (1-4% depending on local conditions) is opaque to nearly the full ir spectrum. but that is not being manipulated by people so the focus of concern in agw is with the 12um band at which opacity of wv and co2 overlap. emitted ir at 12um is absorbed by co2 but that molecule emits the photon and if it meets a wv molecule or the ground the photon will heat those, only to be re-emitted until it's finally lost to space. that is agw theory. the link you presented is the version that the masses can understand since most people don't understand the basics of ir physics.

there is no debate on the climateskeptics sub about the role of wv. as i said previously we all accept some warming from co2. the debate among all is over the value referred to as equilibrium climate sensitivity (ecs) which is the temperature increase expected from a doubling of co2. the range of estimates is from <1c to >6c. that is the current state of agw science; even the people who declare themselves experts and declare that the science is settled can not agree on the ecs.

i got a chuckle over the headline ""water vapor confirmed as major player in climate change"". as if they just discovered that. that has been known to be a fact since the middle of the last century.

i'm not so much trying to disprove anything, just trying to understand... maybe the numbers are made up to fit his narrative... maybe not... i need peers to review this!!",0.909

0,"you don't have to choose between being a climate denier and a climate doomist. i believe in climate change and the obvious fact that it is caused by human activities. i believe that we are in an extinction event, with the very real potential to escalate into a mass extinction event. i believe that we need urgent action and a great societal shift in order to avoid the most dire consequences.

i believe that the environmental crisis represents an existential threat to most life on earth; it is a continuing cause for anxiety and depression.

and yet i have been accused of being a 'denier' or 'hopium addict' on multiple occasions simply because i don't agree with everything every activist claims. apparently stating that modern global warming won't turn the planet into venus 2.0 or that all life won't be eradicated in five to twenty years constitutes being a denier now. apparently saying that we need to take action to limit the harm no matter what because every portion of a degree has a significant impact is somehow 'hopium'.

we need to stop this kind of mentality, it is counterproductive in the extreme. you can recognise the existential threat posed by the environmental crisis without preaching about the immediate end of existence at every opportunity.

i am a huge sustainability fan and think about how we can have an impact on a daily basis.   
what always made me wonder was the fact that we say ""vote with your money"", in other words we should support companies that do good and try to avoid companies that do bad. but why is it so difficult to find these companies that do good? the companies that pay the extra money for a better planet, that go the extra mile?   


i made a tool that collects these sustainable products and companies: [http://sustainablealternativeto.com/](http://sustainablealternativeto.com/)  


instead of trying to come up with a sustainability score or trying to get companies on a directory etc, i thought of a much simpler solution to create a database that lists sustainable brands and products. there are many great labels out there, that do exceptional work to verify aspects of a companies' sustainability. we simply collect them in a huge database and let you filter by each sustainability aspect such as climate neutral, socially responsible (b corp certified), vegan, plastic free, circular, or multi use. 

one thing is clear. the products and companies that fall under these labels are better then the ones who don't. it's as simple as that. are they perfect. no. should we still support them? absolutely. we carefully select only the labels that stood our due diligence, because not all labels are great.

i graduated in winter 2019 with a bs in env. sci. energy and climate. during my courses i found the most interesting classes to me were physics & engineering. i conducted a biogas feasibility study for the entire rural areas of the country of nepal for my senior project utilizing arcgis and climate + civ + biogas system engineering/chemistry data. i'm one course away from a gis cert but it's not entitely all i want to do so it's on hold.

i struggled to obtain any climate based positions. i applied to multiple state (ca) agencies and large environmental/renewable/engineeing firms for energy & technology analyst based positions and i've only had one interview. i avoided private sustainability positions because i feel like i'd lose my mind.

i gave up looking for meaningful climate based work and started working as a ""biologist"" doing research, surveying, protection and primarily monitoring for endangered species, primarily on construction jobs... which has lead to me working for big oil and big polluters to make a living most of the time. occasionally i can land a cool research job in the desert, but now that i'm settling down with my partner, the vagabond 3-5 months away from home life doesn't seem appealing.

i talked with a friend who can help me get an interview as a gis analyst for some of the big renewable energy companies. this is my next play but it's not really where my heart is. 

my ideal job would be doing something like that feasibility study for nepal that did, or doing appropriate technologies (not feasible hehe). consulting for large or small businesses to reduce energy usage or be more efficient. i also think i have a mind that's good for policy. i'm a tinkerer, and a techy, and i think on the macro and micro. i build a lot of gadgets... 

my almamater has offered me to come back to school and get a bs in env. engineering within a year time frame, and then a master's in 1.5-2 years. they also suggested the ""energy, technology and policy,"" master's which i could get into and finish in a 1.5 years. 

i'm really just not sure where to go as most often do. i have a good problem solving mind that likes to build things and make things efficient. i have a passion for policy as well. but i also like that i'm finally making a sustainable income... but i'm working for the ff industry as a biologist most of the time and it's killing me (also the work is mind numbing.) 

should i just stay where the grass is green? or go back to eating ramen and crank out another bs/ma? should i move to the capital and try policy? should i go into gis and be a desk jockey for renewables?

in the end .. i'd like to just be using my abilities to bring some sort of climate solutions... i plan on starting my own consulting company down the line..

are there any jobs anyone would suggest looking into that i've missed? has anyone whose been at this cross roads before have some advice?

tldr: i got s bs in env. sci. energy and climate, but i work as a biologist doing boring monitoring for polluters and want to get work in climate solution based/adjacent field. engineering + data problem solving mind type. suggestions?

how indigenous communities lead the fight against climate change
by david naarlast updated december 17, 2021

 photo courtesy: arterra/universal images group/getty images
the effects of climate change have impacted every area of our planet in countless ways, from threatening the health of crops to creating longer and more intense wildfire seasons around the globe. climate change affects each and every life on earth — but it’s often indigenous communities that are the most directly and severely impacted. this is largely due to “their dependence upon, and close relationship with, the environment and its resources,” such as land, water and animals, according to the united nations.

for this very reason, indigenous groups may stand to lose the most as climate change threatens the health and survival of our planet. in an effort to limit its impacts, indigenous communities around the world are coming up with their own strategies — often by blending traditional land-use techniques with new practices — to combat the effects of climate change. here’s how these efforts are working.

indigenous people have been forced to adapt to climate change

climate change has caused droughts, heat waves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and other adverse physical effects to our planet. indigenous tribes are left increasingly vulnerable as climate-related events affect the general health of their communities as well as their ways of life.

as the

united nations

 explains, “climate change exacerbates the difficulties already faced by indigenous communities, including political and economic marginalization, loss of land and resources, human rights violations, discrimination and unemployment.” from droughts disrupting livelihoods in the amazon basin to rising temperatures “negatively impact[ing] traditional cattle and goat farming practices” in the kalahari desert, climate change is disrupting the ways indigenous communities have long interacted with the environment — and that’s putting their survival in danger.

there’s often a deep connection between indigenous groups and the waters, lands, animals and plant life they have access to. many of these communities spend time outdoors, not only to hunt, fish and plant food, but also for cultural and spiritual purposes. the continuing impacts of climate change are making it more difficult for groups to engage in these culturally important practices and the ways of life they’re critical to.

as climate change shows no signs of stopping, indigenous groups across the globe have had to modify harvesting and other techniques to survive and to keep their communities livable. in doing so, they’re coming up with innovative new ways to fight the effects of climate change, methods that other areas across the world may be able to learn from. “indigenous peoples have always been on the front lines,” says nikki cooley, co-manager of the tribes and climate change program for the institute for tribal environmental professionals (itep) in flagstaff, arizona. “tribes have always been adapting to climate change. now we have to adapt even faster.” here’s what those adaptations look like around the world.

sahel tribes are using traditional water conservation techniques

 photo courtesy: raphael de bengy/afp via getty images
the sahel — the geographic transition zone between africa’s sahara desert and the continent’s southern savanna grasslands — spans nearly 2 million square miles across more than a dozen countries. the area had an estimated population of almost 135 million people in 2015 who depend on livestock and crop agriculture for their food as well as rain for their water supply. extreme droughts have been affecting the land since the 1970s. currently, rain only falls during three months of the year, and climate change is causing that limited rainfall to become even more unpredictable. so, sahelian farmers have had to modify their water- and soil-management methods to restore the fertility of their land.

sahelian groups have created water-conserving techniques like half-moons and zai pits, which are holes in the soil that help to trap water and nutrients. the use of zai pits ultimately increases drought resistance and improve crop yields. another method, called stone bunding, holds back rainwater from running off the land, allowing it to soak into the soil and hydrate crops instead. water-conserving “boulis,” which are large, deep pits roughly the size of olympic swimming pools, also help to catch the water that falls during the rainy months. these methods have helped provide communities with year-round access to water and increased food security for millions.

the swinomish tribe creates clam gardens to improve shellfish populations

 photo courtesy: sawaya photography/getty images
western washington state’s swinomish indian tribal community depends largely on fishing for sustenance. with shellfish populations under threat due to rising sea levels and changes in water temperature, tribe members revived longstanding cultural customs to improve fishing conditions. they’ve begun using clam gardens, which are also utilized in alaska and british columbia, once more to improve access to traditional foods.

to build clam gardens, low-lying rock walls are fortified with broken shells and gravel that create a terrace by “reducing the slope of the beach and increasing the area where shellfish [can] grow,” according to northwest treaty tribes. this has helped the tribe cultivate clams and other important marine foods. the swinomish tribe has been successful in receiving

funding

 for this work from various federal and state programs. ultimately, these efforts “will also bolster local food security, support tribal treaty rights, and provide ecological and cultural benefits to the community,” notes swinomish marine ecologist courtney greiner.

the karuk tribe is developing a climate adaptation plan

 photo courtesy: grandriver/getty images
the karuk tribe in northwest california and southern oregon truly understands the impact of climate change on the world. its territory includes 1.38 million acres in northern california, much of which has been impacted by catastrophic wildfires resulting from a combination of poor federal land management, limited fire suppression and climate change. in response, the tribe has called for the use of its cultural burning practices to build wildfire resilience and protect resources. “the karuk tribe, among others, sees fire as medicine, and, as such, views traditional burning as a human service for ecosystems,” shared dr. frank k. lake, a u.s. forest service research ecologist who’s also a karuk descendant.

this burning is a central component of the karuk climate adaptation plan, which proposes mitigation strategies based on a combination of karuk traditional knowledge and recent climate science. the tribe has found that the frequent use of low-intensity fires has helped to restore grasslands for elk and maintain tanoak trees and black oak acorns. it also provides smoke that shades the klamath river and other streams, cooling water temperatures and saving fish during the hot summer months. the plan incorporates an in-depth summary of climate trends, adaptation strategies for electrical infrastructure and suggestions for the removal of other environmental stressors. the detailed plan, as well as the practice of cultural burning, is now gaining recognition from federal, state and local government agencies.

community and collaboration have been key in these efforts

of course, these aren’t the only indigenous communities that have been using traditional methods to fight the effects of climate change. the nation of guyana has worked with international leaders and organizations on biodiversity preservation efforts. tribes in alaska and hawaii, as well as other indigenous groups, are exploring fishing methods that result in healthier oceans. all of these strategies are highlighting the value of indigenous knowledge and raising awareness about how other, lesser-known techniques may also be helpful in combating climate change.

one of the most powerful reminders in all of this, though, is that community and collaboration, like innovative land-management methods, are vital for our survival. we need to work together to put a stop to climate change — and applying indigenous methods on a large scale may be key in doing so.

0,"i think climate apocalypse might actually save the world let me be clear, i genuinely thought we should stop climate change at first. i am not a troll, or some kind of weirdo. i’m also a vegan activist.

before you start reading: be aware that our desire to live is also biological, not entirely objective. once you realize that, you can be open minded to the idea that non existence is not that bad.



here is why i think one shouldn’t be a climate activist, and shouldn’t make an effort to live a green lifestyle. but the only effort one should make if he wants to do good, is to be anti climate activist. in order to help climate change do it’s thing). i suppose i have had this thought for at least one year, in the darkest deepest part of my mind: the world is full with endless suffering. therefore, it would be better if life didn’t exist on earth at all.

now two things:

• we couldn’t destroy all life on earth even if we tried. we got animals here that can even survive in the outer space for a few years, so that’s off the table.

• if humans weren’t on earth, it would be undoubtedly the best thing that could ever happen. and that’s part of the reason why i want climate change to take over the world(to fully or almost fully extinct all humans). a new better world will be born from the ashes of the climate apocalypse. a world free from humans(that create the most suffering on earth, so much that we can’t even imagine). and the apocalypse might even be worth the suffering it will cause to humans and animals.



i know that animals will die and suffer horribly, and that they will be affected first. but remember, the apocalypse will be an extremely short era in earth’s history, which means that it’s close range consequences will be nothing compared to its long range consequences, which will be good.

most of the avoidable unnecessary victims of now are victims of humans. and yes, the victims of the climate apocalypse will be victims as well. however they will be gone for a good reason for a change.

and it doesn’t really matter who will have to be extinct or be affected first, by the apocalypse. please notice that i have the perfect reason not to have value of life anymore. the life in the wild must be too bad to consider them as good, therfore it’s not a big loss if a lot of animals die. i’d consider to extinct all life from earth if i could. animals in the wild suffer from hunger, injuries, weather. one day i saw that poor cat i saw outside, and then realized that there are a lot cats like him. they absolutely must extremely suffer from the rain and cold. most of us western humans dont know and don’t have to experience even 10% of this pain, because we are so far from this survival situation, thanks to unbelievably accessible and high technology. now think about all the insects, and ants. every drop of rain can cause them the most long and painful death. they must be terrified. and this is only a very little example. this is why i don’t think it a loss of animal life on earth will be reduced due to the climate(life is not that good, even bad).

by the way, believe me, i am well aware of horrible consequences of not stopping climate change, to both humans and non humans. and it does make sad not less that it makes you. but i think i really have the perfect reason to be sure that it will be worth it, for the greater good.

average global temperature seems like the most useless metric imaginable:

* no one experiences the ""average"" temperature, it's a complete abstraction 
* if your summers are 50 degrees hotter and your winters are 50 degrees colder you are dead with average warming of 0
* the planet is mostly covered by water, but basically no one lives on the water.   averaging out air temperature over land and water hides the data you'd want to know
* 1.5 or 2 degrees doesn't seem like a big deal, because it's well within the normal variation within a day or from day to night in a particular place
* what matters are the extremes. kodiak ak broke it's previous record high for the date by 20 degrees!  knowing that some places will be 20 or 50 degrees hotter or colder seems much more useful than discussing a global average.

anyone with an elementary school math education knows that averages eliminate useful data.  that's why you learn average, median, mean, and distribution curves around the same time.  why don't scientists and journalists know this?",0.8353

anyways immediately after this i start coming across videos of people (harvard?) doing experiments to block out the sun!!! and how might they do this? by spraying dust! and which type of dust? calcium carbonate aka limestone or (my personal fav) chalk dust

alright y’all i’m spiraling now, because prolonged inhalation of dust causes respiratory issues, and how funny we have a respiratory pandemic going on!

0,"1963 and global warming the last time the river thames froze completely was 1963, and before that  wasnt common until the early 1800s when it was recognized it was no longer going to be a regular thing

so if we can recognize substantial climate change going back to the 1700-1800s and we are supposed to believe the main cause of climate change is carbon emissions, that would mean we need to get carbon emission to lower levels than the 1700-early 1800s.

commercial use of fossil fuels started in the 1880s,  which is definitively passed this point

that would then mean that we need to lower carbon emisisons prior to the wide spread usage of fossil fuels, meaning the only other ways to reduce emisisons are going to be in population, livestock and agriculture

the popluation in 1750 was estimated to be 814 million people. 

if 814 million people and supporting agriculture with no widespread fossilfuels was already leading to drastic and notable changes in the environment, then wed have to go substantially lower right?

the crocodile attacks have come at a time when iran has been suffering acute water shortages and, consequentially, fast-shrinking natural habitats have seen the gandos' food supplies dry up. the starving animals treat humans approaching their territory either as prey or a menace to their evaporating resources.

scattered across iran and the indian subcontinent, gandos are broad-snouted crocodiles, classed as ""vulnerable"" by the international union for conservation of nature (iucn). iran has an estimated 400, comprising nearly 5% of the species. iran's department of environment says it is doing its utmost to strike a balance between preserving the gandos and protecting local people.

iran's water scarcity is not unique to baluchistan. deadly protests erupted in the oil-rich south-western khuzestan province in july. and in late november, riot police in the central city of isfahan fired birdshot at protesters gathered in the dried-up bed of the river zayandeh-roud.

other things to note: our orchard sequestration is 3.8t which nets off 2t of emissions from fertilisers. we unfortunately can’t ship with zero fossil fuels but i am planning to buy a 3t electric truck for all local deliveries next year.

secondly, and more importantly, the ipcc themselves have admitted in their 31st report in 2009 that a runaway greenhouse effect from anthropogenic emissions is virtually impossible on earth. this is why their 5th assessment dispenses with that narrative and moves onto the narrative of ""regional tipping points"" such as the greenland ice sheet.

the problem lies in the fact that these ""regional tipping points"" were always destined to be exceeded, whether naturally or from anthropogenic forces. so why the panic? am i missing something?",-0.9126

further, the importance of pets in the us has increased since 2017. expenditures in pet-related industries increased from 90bn dollars in 2017 to 109bn dollars in 2020. that is a “whopping” 21 percent increase. if we use the expenditure growth to guesstimate the ammount of emissions from pet food, we obtain that the 64 million tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions have become 77.44 million tons. this sounds large, however, compared to the total emissions of the us in 2020, which equal 6,558 million tons, it seems very small. 
actually just 1.1 percent. so it seems that getting rid of all pets would not really be a significant step to netzero.

most people think about major outcomes of hothouse state as being straightforward like sea level rise and hotter summers. 

but the reality will be far more complex and unpredictable. beyond unpredictable and extreme weather events, we are also looking at 

- major impacts to food systems
- declining ability to care for our weaker members of society as margins for spare resources (and therefore empathy) get thinner
- increase in disease and insect issues
- increasing need to decentralise systems as centralised systems and supply chains begin to falter (energy, food, critical goods) 
- increased social instability as the rule of law gradually breaks down (we're already seeing this even in so called modern democracies)

the biggest thing i read about what individual people can do about climate change, the number one thing that people say is important is to not have kids. and that is something that i can't do, something that i refuse to consider. the number one thing i want out of life is to be a parent, i can't give up on it. i'd say its the only thing preventing me to giving into despair about my hopeless, aimless future, but that's not a post for here. 

before someone brings up adoption, i know it exists. but, it's just not the same in my eyes. i know thats probably a flawed way of thinking, but i cant help the way i feel. 

before someone brings up putting it off until i know any potential child will not deal with potential climate ratifications, i've thought about that in the past but recently i've become convinced its something i want sooner than later.

because of this, i feel like i can't commit fully to fighting climate change. i feel like i'm too prone to coming up with excuses, thinking to myself that my hopes and dreams conflict with climate change efforts so i might as well not try at all.

i'm mostly looking for advice here, not only about trying to do more but also i'd appriciate any ideas of what more i can do in my day to day life, especially considering i live in small-town midwest where a car is kind of necessary to have a life, something that only makes me feel more like i should just not bother trying.",0.925

one morning in particular during march surprised me. the evening of the day before that morning, there was a rainstorm that was very intense that caused me and my family to stay indoors until the rain stopped. i woke up the next day and i could see the water vapour from my breath condense in the air, something i have never seen in thailand before. this ""temporary winter"" lasted a week until the blazing hot sun returned.

this is something that i expected to avoid moving farther north of thailand in udon thani. i've technically seen the same weather pattern in pattaya since the fall of 2020. even now that i have travelled back to pattaya, i still see the same sequence of weather events.

this has been happening for over a year and i would like an explanation to this very odd phenomenon that has been affecting every region of my country. whether this is a sign of a weather event far more catastrophic, or something that people should just tolerate with.

the plastic bag ban in california was my first experience with the issue. my family in california encouraged my family to think twice about our plastic use, especially plastic bags. i remember my mom bought so many reusable grocery bags, and we began to save plastic bags to the point of overflow… we still do this. after joining an environmental science class at my local community college, did i become more informed on the depth of the issue. what concerned me the most were single use plastics. 
single use plastics are everywhere ! i say they are impossible to avoid because, you have to be perfectly mindful about your consumption of plastic and no one is perfect. i feel like i can’t even eat a bag of chips with peace anymore. single use plastics are defined as non recyclable material. many companies impose regulations like restaurants and their type of togo containers, or grocery stores and bags. but there are still so many people who just don’t care or realize the extent of the issue. 
politics is more involved in the issues of plastic pollution than many would believe or like to believe. i think this is where the revolution against plastic pollution beings. countries, cities, states and towns around the world have prioritize overcoming plastic pollution as point of climate change. i’m curious to know any opinions and ideas towards overcoming plastic pollution in the united states. how can we collectively begin to normalize the notion of avoiding and discontinuing single use plastic in general? does the majority focus on plastic pollution as an issue of climate change? as always how can we de stigmatized the politics of climate change?",0.9904

0,"the climate is changing: but that is just the facts. scriptural foundation: matthew 24:3-7, see also : luke 21:5-38 mark 13

the climate is changing.those are the facts, and the reason is not the lie that we have been told. the lie that we have been told is human beings are at fault, the lie is that this person, or that group is at fault. blame is the work of the flesh and satan, the real enemy. we are human spirits and we have a soul ( mind,will and emotions), and we live inside a body, that body is our legal right to live and interact on earth in the natural realm. so, i used to focus a lot on what people said about the climate and then i decided to read the truth for myself. this is what jesus, who is the truth, says in matthew 24:3-7  **the bible version:the passion translation** *“ later, when they arrived at the mount of olives, his disciples came privately to where he was sitting and said, “tell us, when will these things happen? and what sign should we expect to signal your coming and the completion of this age?”*

*4 jesus answered, “at that time deception will run rampant. so beware that you are not fooled! 5 for many will appear on the scene claiming my authority or saying about themselves, ‘i am the anointed one,’ and they will lead many astray.*

*6 “you will hear of wars and revolutions on every side, with more rumors of wars to come. don’t panic or give in to your fears, for the breaking apart of the world’s systems is destined to happen. but it won’t yet be the end; it will still be unfolding.*

*7 “nations will go to war against nations and kingdoms against kingdoms. and there will be terrible earthquakes, horrible epidemics, and famines in place after place. 8 this is how the birth pains of the new age will begin!”.* read the full chapter of matthew 24. jesus gives us the signs that we should expect before his arrival. climate change is one of them. and again in luke 21:5-38, *“ 29–30 jesus gave his disciples this parable: “haven’t you observed that when the fig tree, or any tree, buds and blooms, the season is changing and summer is near? 31 in the same way, when you see these prophetic signs occurring, you realize the earth is yielding to the fullness of god’s kingdom. 32 i assure you, the end of this age will not come until all i have spoken has come to pass. 33 earth and sky will wear out and fade away before one word i speak loses its power or fails to accomplish its purpose.”*   so there we have it. jesus already told us that these were the things to expect before his arrival. however, we do not know the day or the hour he will return, he didn’t tell us that, only the heavenly father knows. so, here are some questions he wants us to focus on: are we born again ? and if we are, are we producing any fruit ? is jesus being shown in our actions and reactions. when we interact with our fellow human beings, are we treating each other like jesus told us to treat each other ? are we loving our neighbor as jesus asked us to love our neighbor ? remember, our neighbors are all human beings. so, how are we treating each other ?",-0.9553

i’ll make this as brief as possible. to offer some form of explanation in terms of the millennial generation offering some form of explanation to those of generation z and those currently protesting and becoming climate change activists.

i would state that my activities in this endeavor started in 2008. i was working as a barback in melbourne’s cbd. i was working up to 32 hours over the weekend and studying fulltime doing a bachelor’s degree at university.

one weekend my father was taking a business trip to canberra, the australian capital territory. i had a friend who was living in the city so i thought i would tag along. i didn’t have enough money for a hotel or anything like that. so i spent the time sleeping in the car until i could get in touch with my friend. it was freezing as i slept in the car. i started to think on the different things that i could do in the act with limited funds. i went to the national library and wrote a short metaphorical piece.

the piece described a situation where we had been invaded by aliens and they had given us the technology to pollute our own atmosphere and thus render the human race extinct through the pollution of their own environment. the next day i visited my friend and was able to print out about a hundred copies of the metaphorical/hypothetical scenario in which aliens had given us the technology to destroy ourselves. i then went around canberra and posted up the pieces of paper around the place. it had the political motivation of promoting clean energy. though in retrospect, it was probably adding to the pollution in printing out the 100 flyers. but no more than advertising for the latest pizza deal.

i did that in 2008. when labor was in power and the greens were pushing for more action on the subject here in australia. because when it comes down to it… it is an existential threat. i would consider that most people are like the ostrich with it’s head stuck in the sand on the issue. they ignore the reality of the situation and just hope it will go away. there’s plenty of issues like this that work in human psychology. people just hope that it will go away… they physically do not have the nerves to face the reality of the scenario.

so the reality of human psychology when it comes down to climate change is a fragmented one. people outright deny the realistic implications of this issue and claim some sort of conspiracy when it comes to the great environmental crisis that lies ahead of us all. we’re closing on the world population of 8 billion now. and because of covid there seems to be some delusion that we have to repopulate the numbers lost.

that’s more birds with their head in the sand. a lot of the world leaders who are currently in power were attempting to do something about the issue. they were placing economic restrictions on the people so that they would control breeding of the population. the problem with this, of course, is that only those people in line with reality would pay any attention to what they can and cannot afford in terms of raising children of their own. and i would think that the world leaders, even they, with their dismal attitudes would be astonished at the general lack of reason that takes place on this planet. the world’s population continues to rise.

so we’re all living in some sort of fragmented reality. people simply do not want to face the vast implications that climate change and all facts relating to this planet describe. those end of world movies… they’re not describing a fictional event. i don’t think they remain a true account of what will happen. but as writers and imaginers our minds run wild with the prospect of all the calamities that we’re facing on this planet. 

the protests describe the g20 summit as a failure. claiming that it’s business as usual. i wouldn’t be so much pointing the finger at these people. i would have the world’s population start taking accountability for their own actions. protests turn into something much akin to rock concerts. people buying food and holding up signs. ‘business as usual’ means something different when we look to how many countries left the paris agreement recently. they’re all returning to a semi-dislocated plan. the transition would start at individual accountability. however, when people bring up that term they usually point to the person sitting next to them and state that they’re the problem. the truth is we’re all the problem. and until we realize that, the world will continue to spiral out of control.

8 billion people! think about that… if you’re planning on having kids or living a normal life. think again. and those 8 billion people are vastly consuming the world’s resources at an epic rate. as a human being we all leave a carbon footprint whether we like it or not. the reality is this message won’t get through to much of anyone. everyone will continue having children and speeding the world towards a pinnacle of disaster.

because when we think about personal accountability in this issue. people just think they’re talking about someone else. human beings are that faulty that i would never prescribe a situation of hope. the only hope that there is in this world with it’s 8 billion people is prolonging the inevitable and keeping everything peaceful enough that we don’t just tear ourselves apart.

i imagine the end of the world much like a world that’s consumed all of it’s physical resources. then those left of us that are sane will all take the pathway of euthanasia. either that or turn towards cannibalism. 

the truth is those that have confronted this issue are in shock of it all. a lot of us did try to fight the system, but then as we took up positions in the workforce realized that we were the system. it’s not a pretty world or experience. but those of us who are aware are just attempting to minimize the harm they do to themselves and others. the fragmented reality that we face in terms of the environmental crisis is in no short term, ‘apocalyptic’.",-0.9886

0,"powering europe with solar panels in the sahara? a question fo the enlightened re solar power:

&#x200b;

in europe, we get most of our fossil fuel sources of energy from far away (nat gas from russia and middle east, oil from me, asia and the us). most comes by tanker, some of it by pipeline.

&#x200b;

it's also a fact that wind and solar energy in europe won't be enough to power the continent on their own: some months there is no wind, some summers there is no sun etc...

&#x200b;

on the other hand, just to the south of europe, we have africa, and in particular, the sahara. 

&#x200b;

why can't we just build a fuck ton of solar panels in the middle of the sahara (in fact, in the south, as the more south you go, the more you solve the problem of lower sun energy in the winter months), and convey the electricity all the way to europe?

&#x200b;

i'm sure i'm missing something obvious here. but if we do it with fossil duels, why not with electricity?

&#x200b;

i guess there is the problem of security (this region is very unstable with terrorist groups left right and centre), and most of all the problem of investments (would require huge infrastructure investments).

0,"why are china and india not taking climate change seriously when they are some of the most vulnerable to sea level rise?  

china didn't attend cop26 and isn't taking the necessary strides to reduce greenhouse emissions. india isn't much better. before you say their per capita emissions are low - this isn't true in practice. a significant portion of the population still live in or close to poverty (in india the vast majority still live in underdeveloped areas, in rural farms and villages); when we only include the proportion of the population who are actually using the energy produced (i.e.: the industrialists/factory owners and wealthy), emissions per person are high and can be expected to increase a worrying amount over the coming years.

now i understand china and india want to prioritise economic growth over climate considerations, but why? the vast majority of china's population live in low-lying areas, and most of china's industrial complex is on the coast, and is very vulnerable to flooding. meanwhile for india, some of its largest cities, like mumbai, chennai, calcutta and visakhapatnam are on the coast and are already seeing the effects of climate change, while much of the north is vulnerable to drought and desertification.

i would understand these countries' attitudes if they weren't very vulnerable to climate change (like russia), but they are - it seems totally counter to their self interests to care this little. and whether it's ""fair"" or not, the future of the planet largely depends on how asia tackles energy production now\*.

why are they not taking the necessary strides to reduce emissions (both countries have the resources and technology to move towards nuclear and hydroelectric) and what can be done to change this?

\*i am not trying to absolve western countries of responsibility here; the us for sure isn't doing nearly enough and its emissions per capita are eye watering, while countries like germany seem to be going backwards, but for this discussion i would like to talk about the asian giants",0.8697

usa: 15%
india: 7%
russia: 5%
japan: 3%

my country “canada” emits 1.6%

canada has committed billions of $$$ to support climate change initiatives and canadian taxpayers are footing the bill.

moving to renewable energy will not stop climate change. it won't even diminish it a bit. the only thing that will stop climate change is to leave economically-viable fossil fuels in the ground. ok...so there is one other way and that is actually removing co2 from the atmosphere (geoengineering, which also nobody is talking seriously about) or wide-scale carbon capture and storage (which is technically very difficult and nobody is talking seriously about).

all cop26 will achieve, even if it is a roaring success by its own lights, is to slow down the rate of emissions. it will make zero difference to the total amount of emissions by the time we stop emitting co2. it will make zero difference to climate change by the time we stop changing the climate.

what is actually necessary is for countries who currently produce fossil fuels to stop producing them. this is simply not going to happen. even the most progressive countries on the planet - best example being norway - have no intention of stopping the production of fossil fuels. on the contrary, they are investing in developing new gas fields. and does anybody seriously think we can stop the saudis pumping oil, or australia digging up coal? this is completely impossible. to make this happen, other countries would actually have to *pay* norway to leave gas in the ground. this suggestion is prima facie absurd, given that norway is one of the richest countries on the planet, but it is also totally unworkable because as long as that gas remains untapped then any future norwegian government could tear up the agreement and extract the gas anyway - so it would have to be an ongoing, never-ending payment. which is simply not going to happen.

conclusion: we are not going to stop climate change. at best, all of this talking  - all this tsunami of bullshit - will just slow it down a bit.

afterthought: 

why is nobody speaking the truth?

answer: because almost nobody is willing to face up to the political realities involved. that's because we're talking about the collapse of civilisation, the end of growth-based, free-market economics and the deaths of billions of people, mainly in the global south.

what i am wondering about is what happens if i am an investor who is *enabling* carbon offsets? the questions really is: when one invests in a project that, 1. can emit high quality carbon credits\* and 2. turns me a profit through dividends, is this investor then actually sustainable? like: if everyone would do this, is this good for the world?

why i am asking: to assure carbon credits to be effective, they should not be double counted *(i.e. i use the credits on my balance sheet and the company buying them as offsets counts the same credits on their balance sheet as well)* but the fact is that the investor's money enabled the credits to be issued in the first place. therefore i could argue that the investor is a sustainable investor, but i can also think of arguments that would say that the investor is not sustainable but only allows others to be.

0,"steve koonin’s book “unsettled” so this weekend i watched a little bit of mitch daniels’ interview of steve koonin - he’s the physicist who wrote a book saying climate change is real, but it’s not bad.  at one point, koonin says, in a dismissive way, that africa needs fossil fuels for development, they can’t possibly get their needs met through solar and wind, “it’s not enough.”  

since my focus has been on his shoddy science (everyone and their mother has written rebuttals), it seemed like a random thing to say. but i read about the problems of electricity in africa and it hit me this is his purpose.  it’s about persuading investors to back fossil fuels in africa. 

a great deal of the continent suffers from lack of access to any electricity - and those who have it, don’t have it consistently. 

and the population is expected to grow much faster than the us. 

and solar and wind are in a great position to provide energy for africa. they get more sun than anyone!!  and solar power is getting cheaper and better!!

western policies have made it more difficult for african countries to build more coal plants, but some are underway nonetheless. the president of uganda just wrote an editorial complaining that climate change mitigation policies imposed on them are unfair because (a) they need more energy now, (b) coal is the cheapest way to get it, and (c) western countries have had the advantage of using cheap energy even though it polluted-his country has just as much right to release co2, and their emissions will be a tiny fraction of what the us has done.  which makes sense - and is the reason for giving them support to go solar. because otherwise they’re trapped by a dependency on coal. which is what the industry wants!!

when i read about the battle over electricity in africa, and saw conservatives who promoted koonin’s book by saying “look, we’re not so bad after all” - all of a sudden the publicity given to koonin by right-wing media made sense. 

the science part is a giant red herring.  nobody’s reading his critiques of computer modeling, any more than we read past page 50 of stephen hawking’s book.  

the point is to soothe investors who’ve strayed from fox news and caught a glimpse of reality - and to keep growing the demand for coal and oil.

and here’s my conspiracy theory - i think koonin’s been groomed by the heartland institute starting at least 10 years ago, when he was in obama’s doe.  because koonin has a big mouth and he’s kind of naive. 

when koonin worked on developing renewables for bp, he said in an interview that governments were going to have to tax people “until it hurt” to get us off of fossil fuels.  how was that a smart thing to say?

koonin has said a lot of things - including this, at mit in 2010:

“‘industry’s goal is not to deploy the most innovative or the greenest technology. the goal is to make money,’ he said. and the scale of investments in energy is so vast that even the government is not in a position to make much of a dent through direct investment: a single, large oil company spends almost as much on research and development per year as the entire department of energy budget, he said.

so to spur innovation and the deployment of new forms of energy, regulation and financial incentives are key, he said. he cited as an example the way installations of new wind turbines in the united states have risen and fallen in lockstep with the back-and-forth passage and repeal of production tax credits for the industry.”

“frank talk on u.s. energy innovation”

if there’s anyone oil companies would want to influence, it has to be koonin’s big mouth. 

koonin claims to have had a come to jesus moment at an apa committee meeting in january, 2014, where he brought 3 heartland institute denialist scientists to debate 3 famous climate research scientists (including macarthur grantee benjamin santer).  but that’s not the truth.  koonin chaired that committee, which was in charge of reviewing the apa’s statement on climate change.  koonin set up the meeting, and when his deniaists lost - he quit the committee. koonin came into that room with his mind already made up.  why would a savvy person even work with heartland, who has been funded by and promoting the fossil fuel industry’s lies for 3 decades?

part of the problem is that heavily populated areas - like along coasts - are going to get mighty uncomfortable in the next few years. let's say even in the next ten years. and millions of people are going to be displaced. huge economic impacts and disruptions. it's not like human extinction or massive life loss is an immediate threat. 

so, you see, dismissing climate change as not a threat - at least not an immediate threat - is at the least short sighted. and all the consequences of the discerned climate trend are not clearly foreseeable. so climate change impacts can unexpectedly become a lot worse than just discomfort, economic, and migration.

---

i have a plot of land in western washington that i bought a few years ago with the hopes of building a house on. covid has delayed that, but i was hoping to start construction in a year or two. however, the more time goes on the more reservations i'm having on making such a huge investment in the western us due to climate issues.

i long figured western wa wasn't /that/ bad climate speaking compared to the rest of the western us. we have a decent amount of water (at least until our snowpack starts to decline substantially), temperatures don't get too hot in the summer (except for rare events like the heat dome from this past summer), and we don't have wildfires on the west side of the mountains for the most part (wildfire smoke is an annoyance but usually the wind from the ocean blows in fresh air and the smoke east, that's a big ""usually"" though).

however, this all will eventually change, sooner rather than later it looks like too. the changes are already evident. the wildfire smoke, eastern wa being a lost cause during the summer, shorter winters, dying trees, shrinking glaciers, etc. plus, our population growth here in the past decade has been extreme making traffic terrible and everything packed with people. not to mention the ungodly amount of cookie cutter neighborhoods that get built but that's off topic.

long story short, i'm getting more and more hesitant to put another ~$500k+ into a region that has so many question marks on it.

i suppose the northeast or great lakes region is a better area but as someone who spends virtually every weekend in the mountains out here i can't bring myself to not be around a mountain range. i've often thought alaska would be a good area to move to since i love winter and the cold, namely the anchorage area. plus i work remotely as a software engineer so i can work from anywhere. southern alaska has plenty of water and moderate temperatures although food availability is a concern if things break down in the future.

so, what's the best move based on what we know may happen in the next 10-20 years? invest a ton more money in western washington or start looking north?",0.9887

to note that it does not talk about climate denial at all, or the physical nature of climate change, but instead is about the creation of a single narrow set of ideas that dominates conversations of how to deal with climate change when it comes to integrating climatology research with economics and public policy.

personally, i found this to be a really interesting alternative take towards climate policy. i do feel like some of the arguments do feel like platitudes:""wouldn't it be nice if opinions were given equal billing to keep all options open,"" but it is a view on climate mitigation that i have not seen before.",0.531
0,"could planting trees actually save the planet? so i have looked up some numbers, some of them being rough estimates though i have found out the following:

about 7000-11000 yrs ago, we‘ve had ~6 trillion trees
today we reduced that by 46% to about 3 trillion trees.

afaik co2 directly correlates by how much the average temperature rises.

we‘ve been putting out well above 30 billion tons of co2 every year for the nearly past 20 yrs
more than doubling the amount since 1970.
(does this number contain manmade breathing too? 500kg-2tons a year..) 

on average, a tree can bind 10kg of co2 per year, so we should average on about 30 billion tons of co2 bound by trees. 


so if we nearly doubled the amount of trees to what it was 10.000 yrs ago, they would be capable of binding 60 billion tons of co2, way above the current numbers of manmade co2.

growing a tree to full adulthood takes like 30 yrs though food bearing matured trees about 4-5 yrs. we have about 8 yrs left of our co2 ‚budget‘.


so could our budget be extended up to actually saving the planet by literally planting trees?

my wife and i are in our 50s and are at a transition point that will take us away from long 60-hour workweeks with our companies and move us toward lower responsibility jobs that require less time and attention as we transition into retirement in our 60s. as we transition away from the ""big jobs"" into something smaller next year, we will also leave the big house in the big city suburbs lifestyle in favor of a more modest home in our desired retirement location someplace in the usa. 

it is the ""location"" part that we're struggling with right now, as climate change has us second-guessing traditional retirement locations like florida. what really caught our attention recently was statements by the u.s. government that they will allow insurance companies to begin significantly raising flood insurance rates, which have largely been subsidized by the government in the past. we have read articles about flood insurance rates in florida possibly pricing people out of homes near the coast in florida and other states just in the next few years. we are obviously concerned, and it has us rethinking the ""where"" part of the retirement equation.

surprisingly, i can't find much concrete and detailed information about this question online at all! 

in particular, i'm interested to know what levels of per-capita (/family-level) material consumption and land-use (housing, etc.) are actually sustainable given the planet's finite resources. 

i know it's not realistic to imagine a world where there is complete equality of lifestyle and wealth across all 7+ billion people, but i think it would be a very informative exercise.

for the purposes of this question, the main constraints on material lifestyle would be their impact on global climate, but i'm sure many other environmental limits are inextricably tied to this as well.

presumably the answer lies somewhere between a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and your average modern european lifestyle. it presumably also depends on whether the world manages to entirely transition away from fossil fuels, which i expect would permit a somewhat greater standard of living.

where i get lost is this. we live several hundred year lifespans. the climate and planet move much slower. despite this, the planet has and will continue to go through dramatic changes. 10,000 years ago much of north america was under miles of ice. incredible. and every 40 ish thousands years we'd alternate between ice ages and interglacials, like we are now. 

the planet has been much much hotter than now, and also much much colder, even 10k years ago when it was roughly 8c colder. needless to say no matter what we do (to the extent the planet can self correct. looking at you forever chemicals) the planet will adjust and adapt. of course we are much less lucky.

so, for a climate that has (at least on its time scale) gone through rapid changes for a very long time. why are we so worried about our impact. sure deciding to burn all the coal we have right now would ruin the climate. but, and here is my main question, why do we worry so much about +2c vs +1c? its a problem we can ease into because the the difference is not that large. it will cause problems of course, but dramatic change to alternative energy sources without being prepared to scale them will also cause problems.

the reality:

we all love being able to wrap up bad things into small packages, it's more convenient for us and we don't have to hold ourselves accountable. so lets blame big corporations and the government. there, two packages in one sentence. how easy was that. the reality is, big corporations only produce what you, me, we demand and western governments being economically driven are of course going to support those corporations. if you truly want to stop climate change you, me, we have to stop buying oil based products when alternatives are available. you, me, we need to stop buying in excess, products we don't really need and single use. you, me, we need to answer to ourselves first and then expect news outlets to tell the real story, not narratives. you...me...we must stop blaming others and accept that we are the villains and the reason for climate change....woman up, and man up to that fact and the first step, the biggest step to reverse the damage will have been taken.

that by itself, i’d be extremely concerned about, but it’s going hand-in-hand with very high extinction rates. ecosystems disappearing, yeah?

and all the while we are rapidly growing as a population. the idea is that the population will naturally decrease as more people get educated and women’s rights improve, but isn’t this somewhat dependent on improved living situations? which is directly tied to not having massive struggles with the environment, education, and getting adequate food. people are more open minded when they’re not afraid and struggling, studies show. 

meanwhile, the west emits and pollutes wayyyyyy too much, even with a relatively small population. excess is a social signifier and humans like social signifiers and resources. also, it feels comfy. the developing world will want this too. 

with the rise in temperatures, weather problems, sea levels, and likely food instability from the ocean dying, people in the equatorial regions are going to migrate north in larger quantities, yes? in numbers that make prior immigration look like child’s play. and, wow, people are sooooo good at responding fairly and equitably to people who don’t speak their language, have a different culture, look different, and are directly competing with them for resources. 

any president or leader that tries to reflect the costs of climate in fuel prices will face a huge backlash because people don’t want to/can’t pay more. biden raising gas prices by $3-$4 would send boatloads of people directly over to conservative politicians because it would hit everyone’s bottom dollar. and then whoever is elected next would likely not do anything for the climate—perhaps wouldn’t even acknowledge climate change. france tried to raise fuel prices because of the climate, it was wildly unsuccessful. france is certainly way more climate-conscious than the americas.

0,"looking for insight on residential construction as a means for carbon sequestration vs. being carbon averse? is it more important to build a structure that uses carbon-capturing materials (e.g. wood) to offer a means to entrap carbon over long periods of time (hundreds of years for a well-designed home), or if its better to avoid materials such as wood in favor of something like cobb that would release little carbon in its construction, but scarcely stores any either.

ideally we'll figure out a carbon-sequestering cement, but i'll have to hold my breath until then. my initial thought is its better to avoid using wood since it encourages monoculture forests and competition is likely to always be high for wood products regardless; however i don't know how we would hope to sequester carbon in any other meaningful way. any thoughts? sources appreciated...",0.965
0,"serious question about climate change almost every time i hear about a new solution for climate change or a new type of sustainable energy source, it never has to do with nuclear energy. why is nuclear fission energy never considered as a legitimate alternative to fossil fuels? and why are other sources of energy such as hdyro, solar, and wind seen to be almost infinitely better than nuclear fission? from my understanding, nuclear fission is only slightly more dangerous than solar, wind, and hyro, but nuclear fission is also extremely more safe than fossil fuels and is also a realistic alternative to fossil fuels (like we already have the necessary technology to do it).

i understand that nuclear fission isn't  sustainable for the long run because of the nuclear waste. but wouldn't switching over to nuclear fission now be a better option than waiting for solar, wind, and hydro to be effective enough to eliminate the need for fossil fuels?

(human activity deniers???) i’ve gotten the general gist that without certain human activities, then our earth would be in a cooling state. but because of that detail, some people say that the emissions are “insignificant in comparison” and then jump to, “humanity hasn’t done much at all, that cooling will always happen so we don’t get global warming,” etc etc.

in short, they’re saying that the milankovitch cycle will “balance it out,” so there will be no warming caused by human activity. they also said that if there is a warming, it will “only” be caused by the cycle. for context, this was from two classmates in my “natural disasters” course.

but… don’t human activities already speed up the warming process?? and greenhouse gases and co2 alone have also been proven to be harmful in multiple ways, not just in warming the climate, so shouldn’t we lower the emissions, anyway? 

and yes, i’m aware that greenhouse gases and global warming have caused mass extinctions in the past (the great dying), other than volcanic eruptions or asteroids of course (as far as i can tell.) but because of those events, my classmates believe that humans are even less involved!

my professor had no response and even said that “all viewpoints are welcome and encouraged.” which is fine in general, but what they said left a bad taste in my mouth. i feel like if people deny this stuff, and if an actual climate-induced catastrophe does happen, they’ll shift the blame on nature alone and continue doing what speeds up the warming. 

anyways, what are your general thoughts or comebacks to that? at this point i’m kinda stunned. i swear i have one-too-many global warming deniers in my area…",-0.8315

0,"where can i find a detailed list of greenhouse gas emission sources? i'm looking for a detailed list of greenhouse gas emission sources because i'd like to try to solve one. just to clarify, i'm not looking for something as broad as 'landfills,' because that's not actionable for any of us. as a specific example, i'd love to find a source that explores each emission source to this extent:

problem: residential produce food waste

* 10% of all emissions come from methane
* 17% of all methane emissions from from landfills
* 23% of all municipal solid waste in landfills is food; 75% of all food waste is landfilled, <25% is composted or combusted
* \~50% of food waste is from residential
* 42% of residential food waste is fruits and vegetables

the problem can be divided into three parts:

1. people buy more food than they can eat because of improper planning (potentially fixed by meal prepping apps or somehow influencing shopping behavior)
2. produce has a short self-life (potentially fixed by shelf-life extending technology, such as removing oxygen from certain fruits)
3. many municipalities do not have a robust compost system because food waste ruins nitrogen proportions in compost facilities and is not financially viable compared to landfilling food (potentially fixed through some type of policy or new use case for food waste)

it took me a bit just to find this single problem. there are thousands that need to be solved in order to reverse climate change and i'd love to explore more that i could try solving. are there any repositories of specific climate change problems?",-0.9

however, i’ve come across some people (both online and in-person) who claim that they believe in climate change, except their way of seeing it isn’t something i’ve heard of before. to be clear, i’m trying to understand things better (i’m on the autism spectrum, so that could explain why it’s hard for me to understand some things at times.) 

their way of seeing climate change is that there is no such thing as global warming, which, i personally can’t see. but then they also bring up how environmental scientists “always predict the apocalypse but it never happened,” and how we’re “practically living under manipulation.” 

so here’s a story:

sometime ago, someone (a likely-middle-aged man) spoke to me in a bastardly way when my friend and i were simply talking about when i’ve learned that the global temperature rising (the one potentially happening in 6 years). 

this guy butt in to try to convince us that we’re being “dictated” and “manipulated” by scientists. not having time for his crap due to how rude and invasive he was, we walked off from our table. he proceeded to follow us. my friend kept telling him to stay away, but i ended up blowing out, “i don’t care if you don’t believe in climate change or not! that is your opinion on the matter and if we can’t convince you otherwise, then you can’t change ours!” 

he then said “climate change is real, but the temperature isn’t warming! in fact, look up the papers written by journalists interviewing scientists in the 60s and beyond and how they freaked out about the apocalypse! none of those events ever ended up happening! look up ‘wrong again!’ in fact, if anything’s making the earth worse, it’s green and solar energy!”

i replied, “oh yeah? well what solutions do you even have if neither of those work??”

“nuclear energy! and for those _____ billionaires to actually stop lying about wanting to save the earth! they don’t care about the sciences and you are looking up to manipulators (seriously, how many times is he gonna say that???) instead of honest scientists!!” yada yada anyways we ran away fast.

to be fair, if someone had these beliefs, i’d be willing to hear their perspective if they didn’t do what that guy did. i did however, look up the research he told us about (i had to type in “wrong again climate”) . from reading everything thoroughly, i got the general feeling that everyone was scared, even the scientists, but, the overall climate is much harder to predict, from my knowledge. from everything i’ve learned so far, it’s that the earth is always going through changes, and as soon as you think the world is ending, it doesn’t. i could be wrong for any of this, so feel free to correct me!

i also did some research on renewable energy, and there were mixed studies, as well as mixed articles. and yeah, nuclear happens to be the safest of all energy sources (as far as i can tell) but i’m still a bit confused… can anyone elaborate on his viewpoints? because nuclear energy and the predictions of climate cooling were also by scientists, and one of the scientists predicting the apocalypse in the aforementioned articles is pro-nuclear. and people did take action to help the planet thanks to those scientists, even though that guy saw it as “brainwashing.” 

there are just so many unanswered things in his arguments. coincidentally, i watched a video on climate change last night, and there was a thread with someone holding very similar opinions to that man, to the point where i actually think they’re the same person… that’s what prompted me to post this. 

and i know i shouldn’t be bothered about it, but seriously, i’m just… perplexed. and tired.  i’m open to hearing your views; anything you got!
if you don’t have an answer to this, feel free to leave a fun fact or some sources discussing climate change/debunking those “anti-science” claims. at the end of the day, i just wanna learn some sh!t lol",0.9919

0,"carbon sequestration idea i had an idea about practical carbon sequestration and wanted to bounce my idea off the community.  i haven't done enough research to run the numbers on this but it seems like it has some potential.

the idea started with imagining how an ideal carbon sequestration machine might work.  it would be some sort box that air would pass through, carbon dioxide would be split into carbon and oxygen, and the carbon would be solidified in a stable for that could be stored long term.

my idea was initially imagining this thing spitting out plastic cubes as a practical dense form of carbon.

then i thought about the energy cost of this machine and how many machines would have to be made, and then i realized, i am describing trees.  a tree sucks carbon out of the air and traps it in its structure.

so i was thinking, what if we grew a ton of trees and then weighed then down and dumped them in the ocean?

then i got to thinking about what grows faster than trees.  bamboo!  from what i have heard, it is one of the fastest growing plants and can be harvested continually.  

then i was thinking that wood has a lot of non-carbon in it that takes up space.  so what if we build furnaces to convert the bamboo into charcoal?  it eliminates nearly all non-carbon weight and can make it far easier to transport.

so as far as storage, my idea was a piping system to pump a combination of water and crushed charcoal deep into underground cave system and used mines.  the water functions to smoothly transport the charcoal, and make sure it settles deep into the caves.  

now charcoal is essentially an energy source, and we are going to have a hard time convincing people to throw perfectly good energy back into the ground, and it defeats the purpose if we are still pumping oil out and mining coal out, so for this to be effective, we will need to also be off fossil fuels, or at least only using them sparingly for certain applications where alternatives are not practical.  

if we setup enough of these cells which involve huge fields of whatever fast growing woods suit the area, with nearby caves to store the carbon, i think this could work.  it might also be useful if growing trees to collect the good quality lumber from the trees for construction, and carbonize all the offcuts and wood chips to capture that carbon because a piece of lumber still sequesters carbon for the next hundred or so years until it degrades.

0,"solution to climate change: stop changing instead be aware. heres my philosophy about how to be a mature human, first when you come out as a baby you're perfect and curious the way you are, now you get affected by life which changes you in many ways to fit into norms, to gain maturity you have to understand that you were perfect once, your emotion, how you reacted and what you did, but also understand how society changed you and understand those changes.

so how does that transfer to climate change?

i strongly believe in that you can't change others, but you can change yourself. and you have to lead by example, so if you want to ""fix"" the climate you should ""fix"" yourself. (i see as humans as a part of nature)

and as i just pointed out, when we were born we were perfect as ourselves, so here comes my solution, you have to stop changing yourself, stop trying to control your emotions, instead try to understand them, because they're apart of you, stop shaving your hair, stop covering your face with makeup, stop covering your smells with deodorant/perfume.

you should listen to your own stomach and emotions, and stop listening to what the norms say, you should be curious about what makes you feel better in the long run, what you eat, what you say, how you react. stop listening to people who say you should feel in a certain way or be in a certain way, because they're not listening to you, not seeing your needs.

so slowly we will become a part of our own individual nature, be in touch with ourselves that way we can be in touch with others/nature.",0.9318

&#x200b;

i find very odd that all of a sudden a natural product like meat is considered more harmful than a normal crop.

i get that they consume more water and take up more space when you consider the food needed to feed it.... but its not like cows are outside of natural cycles.

the water they consume evaporates or exits them in some other fashion and re-enters the water cycle.

the meat itself is also part of the cycle of food where they eat grass, we eat the cow, our shit fertilizes plants and so on.

even the methane they fart also has its own cycle and gets back into nature.

&#x200b;

the biggest problem with meat, from what i can tell, isn't really a problem specific to meat. the problem is breaking those natural cycles stuff has.

left over food for example. it doesn't get reintroduced into nature, we just let it rot somewhere. producing even more methane and taking away nutrients that could be used somewhere else.

&#x200b;

i have the strong impression that climate change won't be solved by stopping anything, but by re-introducing nature into society and integrating it into how we do stuff.

cities could have compost piles or even community led pig pens. that way we have a way to deal with organic trash making it into fertilizer and pigs that can even be later made into meat (effectively recycling the food) or just bury it.

&#x200b;

i'm also not a big fan of lab meats. i *guess* they can be good for the environment, but, if nutrition taught me anything, the more industrialized it gets, the worse it is for you.

if there's actually a case to be made to stop eating meat, there's no reason to resort to industrialized slurs that are meat flavored. just go full vegetarian.",-0.8818

(though i do know that in many places rainforests preserve climates of the past that would not exist were the plants to be removed, due to evapotranspiration & other factors).  


but i bring this up because i know that certain environments like steppes and peatlands are very effective carbon sinks since when the plants die, their remains are buried by other growing plants, or are submerged in aerobic environments which prevent their decay and prevent the carbon from being released. but this doesn't happen so much in forests, does it? because, in general, in healthy forests the floor will be somewhat bare of grasses and other plants that bury remains like in steppes, right? so how is it that preserving forests helps to lower carbon emissions or prevent climate change?

i could consider installing heat pumps, using all electric heat, and rely on the conversion of the grid to renewable sources to reduce the carbon footprint eventually.  my utility's renewable percentage is currently abysmal, just 3.9%, but that will surely rise over time. heat pumps will cost me more than furnaces. in the short run, 5 years, heat pumps will have little improvement in carbon footprint over gas furnaces because of the dismal renewables portion of this utility. 

i wonder about the odds of natural gas being phased out over the expected lifetime of these units (15 years).  if we can't buy natural gas, or it's made to be uneconomic to disincentivize it, heat pumps would be a great idea.  but natural gas in ubiquitous - is a phase-out even on the table? 

there is the potential of offsetting some of the dirty power with on-site solar, no economic payback for me as the tenant's pay the utilities.

the more morbidly curious of you might search in hope of figuring out. learning about near death experiences and the feelings connected with them. maybe learning about the chemistry of a dying body. maybe even watching somebody die, either getting executed on some live leak video or eaten by some animal. and in all this frantic anxious searching what did you find out? did you really learn what it is to die? to be dead?

you may have seen a person’s pain as they are ripped apart or they plead for life. if you are particularly empathetic you might have almost felt that pain. but that pain is knowable, it can happen and be reanalyzed by our brains. but there is no empathizing with  a dead body. there is no body language or voice to interpret, there is nothing, because a dead body isn’t a person anymore. they are just what a human being really is, a pile of meat, bones, and chemicals. 

there is a certain irony that i sometimes think is lost on people that we are using the remains of a long dead ecology to lead us to a similar demise. not just in the dramatic irony, like a villain dying by a weapon of his own creation. but in the idea that we at least in some way can imagine what it’s like to die, at least as a civilization.

what is our response to this? is it a frantic anxiety? an aloof resignation? no it is complete and utter awe. the idea that best explains how little we matter, that we really are just meat, bone, and chemicals. 

there are a lot of things that we hear about climate change, pretty much all are true and all are horrifying. constant intense storms, rising waters, droughts and massive fires, etc. but those are things humanity can survive? they will be horrifying and devastating but we have survived disasters before. no the most deadly thing is the massive level of ecological change. 

throughout the many extinction cycles there is one thing that ensures the death of a top predator, massive, unassailable ecological change. this is because of the massive dependence they have on the rest of the ecology they exist in, if that changes their evolutionary advantage is made moot. drastic enough over a short enough period of time and there is no amount of evolution that can fix that. that species is selected against, extinction. what i’m trying to say is we aren’t going out with a bang we are going out with the last whimpers of the starving.

now one can imagine some historical contingency happening in the next 20 years where the devastation is so severe that there is no other direction to go but work to fix this problem. for me this brings up thoughts of the cuban missile crisis. there are lots of important contingencies in this piece of history but one that i think is very important is the us election of 1960. it is very likely kennedy could be considered the most stable hand at the wheel of any us president. he constantly doubted the info the cia gave him and pushed back against much of the hawkishness of his administration because of the failure of the bay of pigs invasion early in his term. if we had nixon handling the big red button we would likely be living in a nuclear winter right now.

the big thing i’m trying to say is that no matter how devastating an event might be it doesn’t suddenly mean things are going to suddenly align and work out, those are separate events. more importantly climate change isn’t a bang. we already let millions die every year from starvation even though we have the resources, how many millions more until we decide to change it? 

on easter island there use to be lush forests, the logs were often used to create not just there boats but also to help them move the moai, those giant stone heads they believed were tributes to their gods. at some point all the forests were chopped down inevitably leading to the fall of the rapa nui people. someone had to have chopped that last tree down. what do you believe they were thinking? do you think they even knew? how could they if it’s so hard to imagine one’s death.

my useful discussion here, beyond just arguing there is a rather large non-zero chance humanity will not see the end of the century because of the way historical contingency seems to work, is that our failure to do anything meaningful about climate change yet is not because people are dumb or selfish, but because of a failure of imagination.

is that a worthy epitaph for the tombstone of humanity? a failure of imagination. in context of all that i ask one final question of you reader,

0,"go gang green!!! climate change/global warming is undoubtedly real. anyone thinking otherwise probably still leaves cookies out for santa, or just hasn't ever thought about it and possess a futile iq. 
we have reasons to believe there was an ice age....so obviously there's been a trend of warming since then. so those who deny the planet is on a warming trend should probably have there tongues and fingers removed to prevent them from sharing any info about anything. 
the natural warming occurrence of the planet has obviously been given a steroidal injection by means of human activity. i believe that should be pretty fn obvious. im not a researcher or scientist with a lifetime dedicated to finding a cure, so like most people, i'm pretty ignorant. but unlike most, i'm able to admit that. 
tbh, idk if i'm more terrified by the ""woke"" or ""unwoke"" population. 
its hard to place blame on the ""unwoke"" older generation of people. all of the blame belongs to some of those fuckers but for the most part i can't blame the majority. i don't care if they still think climate change is fake, oswald shot jfk, and man has walked on the moon. its not their fault, they lived an entirely different existence. i've always questioned everything so its hard not to judge them for believing everything they were told, but thats how they were trained from infancy. do what your parents say. unfortunately, everyone was brainwashed from the top of society and had no real opportunity to escape that facade. so they've lived a life of being mislead. sure they could become awaken in today's world and for younger people its easy to say they should. i can say with almost total certainty that when i'm 70-80, (old af), i will have 0 desire to change a lifetime of beliefs while i coast out the rest of my days. again, its easy for present day me to say old me is an inconsiderate p.o.s., but old me is worn out and very likely tired of things changing. aside from a few, most everyone i knew is dead, the places i made cherished memories are gone and replaced with concrete and stores. i would find it very hard to put energy towards developing a new way of thinking while i hang on to happy memories that happened under different planetary/societal circumstances. totalitarian blame deserves to go to prior generations. ima guess that very few/none of us has ever conversed with those deserving of the blame. 
so next time you talk to someone that is obviously not living in reality, don't get pissed at them and judge the entire slew for what they believe. personally, i just make an internal note of sympathy on their behalf and go on my way. i don't debate with or try to change what they think. mainly because i don't waste time and energy on shit void of benefits and also i like the idea of letting people die happy with their beliefs. i can't imagine too many things worse than approaching the light at the end of the tunnel with some serious internal conflicts going on.
my empathy and sympathy pertains to 99% of them that aren't really at fault in the first place and can't really help with improvements anyways. instead of fighting with and trying to change the 1% able of making change, they just need to be removed from their positions. how? idk, but energy would be better spent on removal than transitioning them.

actually, i guess i do know who i find more terrifying. its not the diminishing group that got put us in this position. their damage is already done for the most part. 
i am a bit scared of the wokes, though. i love people having the mindset of making things better and conscious of the planet's wellbeing. i like it, (i like it a loht). i like people wanting to become more aware and knowledgeable. i don't like how people think they are better than others just because they have interpreted information they believe is 100% factual. 
pretty much the only guaranteed fact that exists is that we ultimately don't know shit. we may have evidence suggesting its factual, but how do we know we have all of the evidence? how do we know the evidence has been interpreted correctly? even if it was, was it correctly/truthfully communicated by those in the know? 
as hard as it is for me to imagine past people just believing what they were told even though they had very little information  accessible to them. its harder to believe that today people can be so certain about something they read somewhere. i mean i get the psychological reasons, its easy to get on board with something that aligns with what we believe and vice versa. i just feel we as a species should be past those by now. the simple fact that there is probably a completely contradictory side to whatever it is should make people at least stop and think like, hey maybe there is a 1% chance its not how i think, instead of just disregarding the fake news. there's at least 3 sides to every story and that only gets vastly multiplied on the internet. so how are people able to be so certain? 

i'm pretty positive humans are fucking up the planet. i am about as sold on that  as i can get. i'm just not necessarily sold on the reasons that people with hidden agendas say. i'm not suggesting their claims of pollution and emissions are bogus. that shit seems pretty obvious. i don't need to read an intellects article to ""inform"" me. what happens when you sit in a running vehicle in a closed garage? lightheaded, nasuea, and eventual death. right? why would anyone think the world isn't a much, much larger garage? exactly, so combustion engines are killing us, should be obvious. many of the things that are supposedly killing the planet seem pretty obvious. you won't find me saying any of it is good and isn't getting momma earth all hot and bothered. 
i graduated from college with a bs, but common sense is far more educational than any university course. it may not produce an expert in any one field, but it does provide knowledge that is widely applicable. it serves as my base information source on most topics and is responsible for the a lot of my actions and beliefs. 
maybe i'm just a dumb/ignorant farmer that grew up and spent most of my time in the middle of nowhere. honestly, i was quite shocked when i heard the news that i'm apparently one of the main reasons causing the impending doom. if it weren't for motivatimed agendas i would have never been aware of the devastating consequences of my daily actions. 
i've always been fascinated by and appreciative of the big momma e. most notably the ground where things grow and the air i breathe. even as a tike, i was conscious of what humans were doing to her. i would compare the present day way of living and the affects to the wild west days of horses buggies. i wasn't really aware of the magnitude of destruction or anything but i just felt it wasn't as pure of an existence we are living. so anytime i think about the impact of humans, i compare present day with the pre industrial days.
i still have a lot of room for more wokeness to learn how i can quit contributing to killing all of us. but as i await the opening of my eyes i can't help but view things through common sense lenses. 
im not delusional and believe that farming doesn't have negative environmental effects. i mean, i literally can't think of anything that doesn't for fuck sakes haha. i guess my astonishment upon hearing the news that i'm a horrible being came from the fact that i've never became nauseous or suffered a headache from breathing the air on a farm. my eyes haven't burnt from the hazey cloud hanging around. with wide open montana being a possible exception, idk if there's a more rural area than where i live. its literally agriculture for hundreds of miles in every direction before there is any type of substantial mass of people and pavement. if there was an area where the immediate effects of farming were felt, id be in it. so forgive my dumbfoundedness. anytime i go to a metro area for a few days i can't wait to get back so i can breathe good air again. i realize the detriment can extend beyond the immediate area, but to claim the emissions from farm machinery is a huge problem is beyond ignorant to just fucking stupid. maybe 40-50 years ago when there were 10 tractors pumping out the black smoke in every field. i'm sure there's an industrial park in one city that produces what all tractors collectively emit. 

common sense also suggests something i have never seen or heard anyone mention a contributing factor to the world heating up. i've seen the studies showing the correlation of hotter temps and cars over the last 100 yrs. i'm not saying cars don't emit naughty gas. but why doesn't anyone take it a step further? have you ever seen or heard about the tire problems of 100 yrs ago? i don't guess i really have either. i'm not an expert, but if i had to guess, i'd say they did indeed have tire issues. it wouldn't have been from all the kids uglying up all the streets by burning their tires and leaving black marks everywhere. it would've been from the shitty/rocky/unpaved roads they drove on. if one was to consider every highway, road, and street that is paved, they would realized quite a bit of earth is underneath. don't forget about everything like parking lots, runways, steel buildings ect. it may not seem like much on the grand scale of things. but you're fucking higher than i've ever been if you don't think the sun beaming off of all of that heat-retaining concrete, asphalt, ect hasnt made things a tad warmer. when i compare today to the way back days, i can't help but feel pretty confident in thinking that the accumulated effect of today's landscape wouldn't play a significant role in the accelerated temperature rise. 
it also probably doesn't help that watering restrictions are causing people to add more rock and artificial turf to their yards. when i was doing landscaping up by the city the grass to not grass ratio was crazy to me. i grew up on a dirt road without any pavement for 8 miles. so going to these ""country houses"" <- was funny to me. first off, i could probably throw a baseball from one spot and hit 30 houses and there were hundreds more lined up past those. each one had a very small patch of grass in front and one in back maybe twice the size. nearly everyone had some type of rockscape that equaled the front grass. with a paved street, sidewalks, driveways,  and the house itself i'd guess that maybe 5-10% of land in a neighborhood had living grass or plants. and that's the earthy part of cities aside from a park here and there. which are completely surrounded by heat-retaining earth-covering materials. 

but i guess educated persons don't see it the same as i do. there will be more natural earth smothered for human luxury next year and the years following.  while experts and wannabe sperts ignore the obviousness of it and direct their blame elsewhere. 

writing this might have convinced me that this is far more detrimental than just a small factor like i originally believed. maybe i have too much respect for big momma e and her powers but something tells me she is capable of fixing herself. im sure its more likely that she would be able to fix herself in terms of the greenhouses gases that originated from within her in the first place. maybe were putting them out at a rate she can't contend with, maybe she can adapt a quicker method. i think in time she could also overcome the concrete blanket she's getting but not at the rate we keep knitting additional pieces. there's just no fn way she can conjure up that kind of healing power to compete at this pace. 

maybe i'm way wrong, maybe i'm just defensive and not easily accepting of the never-ending attacks on ag, so i'm fabricating the first alternatives i can think of. i'm not accusing anyone of anything, i believe that as conscious individuals most people are good. at least in their core. seemingly all to often it can get masked by their greed and ego. 
genuine planetary concern is becoming more and more prominent and that's a great thing. i just hope everyone can check their hiprocracy at the door and refrain from making attacks towards others without really knowing the reasons for such attacks. 

what would an alien, with no previous knowledge or bias, perceive as being more environmentally toxic if they were to spend a week on a farm and a week in the city? 

i believe there's pretty much only one solution for legitimately reduce the wounds of the ass kicking we've been giving big momma e.    (aside from a mass depopulation, which wouldn't actually be a solution as much as it would just prolong the consequences of our behavior). 
there are other potential solutions that may come to fruition in the future. but as of today, there's only one solution that i can see for true change to actually happen. though it'll never happen, not until its far too late and it simply has to happen. 
if every human was a vegan and every vehicle was electric, would the world be saved? i'm pretty sure the answer is no. the destruction might get delayed, but no one knows what the consequences of today's actions will be in fifty years. unless we find/build something that can make everything us humans need out of thin air, our attempts will be moot. 
any green movement or vegan agenda won't matter without an extreme societal    change in civilization. but like ive already said,  that will never happen.  
this is already wayyyyy longer than intended so i'll save my solution for those that are interested. cause lordy knows this one is long enough, haha.

as the planet warms, new mechanisms we still struggle to understand start to kick in and reinforce the warming trend: i'm talking about melting ice caps reducing the albedo effect, huge wildfires turning carbon sinks (forests) into carbon emitters, melting of permafrost releasing methane and warming of the oceans also releasing methane.

0,"contaminación por quema combustibles fósiles ¿opiniones? antes que nada partir definiendo lo que es la quema de combustibles fósiles y por qué se hace. los combustibles fósiles son materia que tiene un origen orgánico que ha sido fosilizada. este concepto como bien dice el nombre es quemar fósiles para generar energía a partir del calor, pero al mismo tiempo gases de efecto invernadero.

los gases de efecto invernadero son gases atmosféricos que absorben y emiten radiación dentro del rango infrarrojo. este proceso es la fundamental causa del efecto invernadero.​ los principales gei en la atmósfera terrestre son el vapor de agua, el dióxido de carbono, el metano, el óxido nitroso y el ozono.​ estos gases de efecto invernadero afectan a nuestra atmósfera porque esta los absorbe y aumenta su temperatura lo que por consecuencia impacta a la biósfera principalmente ya que algunos seres vivos por el aumento de temperatura pierden su hábitat natural o simplemente no soportan altas temperaturas.

los combustibles fósiles se dividen en tres tipos unos más dañinos que otros como por ejemplo el más usado el hulla que es el más contaminante por su gran cantidad de azufre provocando lluvia ácidas, la antracita es la forma menos común de esta y la menos dañina el problema es al ser la menos común es la más costosa de extraer y por último el lignito posee poca cantidad de carbono por lo cual es la que tiene menos poder calórico y por lo tanto la menos relevante. 

la quema de combustibles fósiles pueden generar lluvia ácida, la cual es producida por partículas de dióxido de azufre y óxido de nitrógeno debido a la quema, al reaccionar con las partículas de agua y oxígeno proveniente de las nubes  generando ácido sulfúrico y  nítrico. este fenómeno puede conllevar consecuencias de gran magnitud, como disminuir el ph en ríos y lagos, además, cualquier ser vivo ya sea animales marítimos o terrestres, plantas y vegetación en general que tenga contacto con ésta, probablemente muera.

con todo esto dicho podemos decir que la quema de combustibles fósiles contaminan y dañan principalmente la biósfera, dañando seres vivos y sus hábitats. aparte de esto afecta a otros factores de rebote del sistema climático como la hidrósfera, criosfera, atmósfera y litósfera. creo que es una buena idea cambiar la fuente de energía por ejemplo cambiar a energía nuclear o eólica, ahora no creo que sea muy rentable por temas económicos y también sería difícil convencer a las empresas de hacerlo. ¿crees que es una buena idea cambiar la fuente de energía? ¿sería rentable?.",0.2593

it's a simple ask but could be a stellar learning opportunity for young folks that may not be super aware of the impact of global warming and its scale. 

**backstory**: there was a recent twitter post from a wisconsin-based meteorologist mentioning the number of **90+ fahrenheit** ""high"" days in the month of august (shattering records, of course). here's where it gets interesting: a local elementary teacher followed up and said she would use the data from the local news station's graph as a histogram example for her next class (unfortunately this graph captured the 90+ days from the last few years, which should be alarming enough).. jokingly, but hopeful, i mentioned maybe using the last century's worth of 90+ fahrenheit days (in wisconsin) as part of the lesson. 

well, i bit off more than i could chew in terms of the data. this wonderful educator (god bless her, especially as one that cares enough to source online for new ideas), followed up and said she'd use the data if it was in an accessible format.

this year is a different story. it’s the same, but worse. i just came back from a trip i took to central california. the smoke from bend down to the yosemite valley was blanketing the landscape the entire drive. i spent a few nights on a house boat where i had no option but to inhale the toxic air. it was clear ish when we boarded but quickly became worse as fires sparked up around the lake we were on. i drove home yestersay and the situation from california to oregon has become much worse. more fires, more smoke, the whole way. scorched forests lined the roadways, not an animal in sight.

0,"3 easy ways to reduce your carbon footprint an average carbon footprint of a human in us is 16.5metric tons per year.

1) update your mode of transportation
transportation or burning of petrochemicals is one of the major contributors to greenhouse gases and thus global warming. switching to an ev or using public transportation will reduce 2.4tons of co2 emissions per year.

2) eat a more plan based diet
just by switching to a plant based diet, you can reduce your carbon footprint by 1ton/yr and a plant based diet comes with several benefits such as significantly lower chances of obesity, diabetes and heart attacks.

3) have fewer children
i am not one to tell anyone to not have kids. but we still need to be aware of the consequences of growing our species. more people means more compeition for resources and increased emissions. one can reduce their carbon foortprint by 60tons/yr just by having 1 less child.",0.6808
0,"mid-term viability of coastal real estate with higher elevation? hi there — hope this isn't so-broad-it's-dumb, but i'd love if anyone could give me some advice about where to start. my mother owns property on the north shore of long island, ny and is considering investing in a substantial addition to her home. i'm somewhat concerned about the long-term prospects of keeping this house within the family, as it's fairly close to the shore — i am more of a mind to get us all away from the coasts, on general principle. but i would like to become better informed on the relevant factors (i'd probably be the one having to dispose of the house eventually).

her house is set back about 300 feet from the shoreline — and, perhaps more importantly, sits on a ridge about 80 feet above sea level, so (*if* i understand correctly) not in any danger of being literally washed away or directly impinged upon by beach erosion.

i'd like to get a better handle on to what extent, if any, this significant height above sea level should be reassuring. i have looked at various projections on the noaa sea level rise viewer and it seems like her property, and those similarly situated, would be technically unaffected even given enormous rises in sea level. the tract her house is in also rates very low (not vulnerable) on their vulnerability index. 

but i realize that this is simplistic and ignores the many other factors affecting the future livability of coastal communities as sea levels rise/climate changes. (as one example, her area is vulnerable to the already-evident increase in frequency/severity of tropical storms.)

long story short, i'd like to arrive at a more nuanced assessment of ""how shitty might it get"" — so we can intelligently think about whether it makes sense for my mother to invest more in her property, or whether she should ditch it while the ditchin's good. am i coming at this the right way? can anyone suggest any pointers as to where to start with research?",0.9923

0,"planting trees is pointless, but i might have a much better solution. many people think planting trees is a good idea, but with a bit of math you easily see that this is pointless. there is in total 3208 billion tons of co2 in the atmosphere, and of this 1074 billion tons are from us humans. so how many trees would it take to do that?

the mass of a larger tree is around 9t, 40% of which, or 3.6t is dry mass which for simplicity we assume are carbohydrates with the simplified chemical formular c(h2o). so how much carbohydrates would have to grow to remove the 1074 billion tons of co2? and how many trees would that be? to know that, we have to multiply the mass of co2 with the molar mass of c(h2o) = 30g divided by the molar mass of co2 =44g, then divide that by the dry mass of a tree.

1074 billion tons \* (30g/44g) = 732 billion tons of carbohydrates

732 billion tons / 3.6t = 203 billion trees!

you would need 10 thousand team trees to do that. also each tree needs around 6m (50ft) of space around it, so one tree would need (6m)² \* π = 113m² (1214ft²) of land, this times 203 billion trees would be a 23 million km² (8.9 million mi²) forest we would have to plant, which is 4 times the size of the amazon rainforest. i don't think we even have that much land to spare where trees could grow. i think came up with something that might actually be realistic and would love to know what you guys think.

**an alternative solution**

trees grow rather slowly, an average hardwood tree takes about 15 to 20 years to reach 9 tons, so why not plant something that grows faster, like bamboo? the fastest growing plant is a chinese bamboo tree that grows up to one meter or 3 foot a day and grows to 25 to 30m in a months. with a diameter of 25cm (10 inches) one meter weights 30kg (66lbs), with a water content of around 50% that's 15kg (33lbs) of dry mass (carbohydrates), so a mature tree would have around 0.8 tons (1800lbs) of dry mass, and it needs only about 1.7m² of land. so if we would wanna remove all 1074 billion tons of co2 at once, how many bamboo trees and how much land would we need? so we already know we would need to grow 732 billion tons of carbohydrates to remove all that co2.

732 billion tons / 0.8 tons = 915 billion bamboo trees

915 billion \* 1.7m² = 1556 billion m² = 1.556 million km² 

so in theory with bamboo we would only need around 1.6 million km² (600 thousand mi²) which is almost 14 times less then with trees as well as 20 times as fast. i'll admit, this would be under ideal conditions, so in practice it would most likely take more land, probably several times as much. but even if we need 5 or even 10 times as much it would still be far superior to planting trees.

we probably couldn't plant them all at once, it would be more practical to plant bamboo forests every year and cut them down next year to plant new bamboo trees in the same area. we might also use several fast growing bamboo species that can grow in different climates, that way we can spread it out into several forests around the world. the other species won't grow a meter per day, but probably still fast enough.

of course all this would result in 732 billion tons or 915 billion m³ (32 trillion ft³) of wood, that's 915 km³ (220 mi³) or a cube with a side length of 9.7km (6 miles). that's way more then the entire world could ever use, and we'd have to find ways to permanently store that somewhere. we could roast it to charcoal and press it to get 293 billion tons of coal which would reduce the volume to one sixth, which might be challenging to do at this scale.

anyway, if you have any criticisms i'd love to know. i know this solution sounds crazy, but i think at this point we have to seriously consider solutions like that, i see no way we could make it otherwise at this point. i think we have to spread the idea of planting bamboo instead of trees, since it could actually be a realistic solution and not just virtue signaling.",0.995

recently i have done some research on which method's make the most sense in terms of compensating inevitable intercontinental flights.

the two most commonly used options are donating to climate projects (as atmosfair does) and paying to use sustainable aviation fuel, the difference being that in the first case co2 gets compensated elsewhere and in the second case direct emissions get cut by 70-80% (this is being offered by compensaid f.e.).

while the second option might seem preferable, now the calculation that makes me struggle between the two. 

atmosfair is charging 23€/ ton co2 for a compensation within a reasonable timeframe. 

compensaid is charging 450€ for saf that is equivalent to avoiding 1 ton co2 being emitted. 

for that price atmosfair can compensate about 20 tons of co2.

this is simple snowballing cause and effect. i now need a car to get a job to pay the taxes.... (which mind you, my ggrandpa inherited his land from his father)... but i need a car to save money to buy land in the first place, which is a humanitarian travesty. the amount of co2 emissions i put into the atmosphere with my 3hr commute every day just to buy this small spit of land and old house is absurd! the car then need repairs, insurance, and gasoline which require even more time and more money causing wars and bloodshed to gain control over limited oil. then i need to compete with other folks for those jobs to pay the taxes, which means i need to learn other competitive skills (besides farming) just to continue to pay the tax bill. this means i must divert my time, money, and energy to higher education, which require more driving, more roads, and more gasoline, and more car repairs to learn other trades. soon enough, i no longer have time to maintain the farm and must abandon farming to pursue full-time employment. 

i am now a slave to the system with crippling anxiety and depression. the loss of farm income and homegrown fruit and veg nutrition, means that i need supplemental nutrition from the grocery store, which requires more money, and more competitive employment, and more gasoline for the big agricultural tractors and mining operations to farm it for me and package it, and to go to the grocery store to purchase. lower nutrition and stress cause higher risks of cancer, and more medical bills. more medical bills means more money and more and more and more and more!!!! industrial agriculture owns all the farm lands, and the more land that is purchased up by big agriculture means that there is less affordable good land, when further increases property taxes, starting the vicious feedback cycle all over again. not to mention how they rape the land bare of nutrients and living micro-organisms... and cause mass deforestation and chemical fertilizers that runoff and pollute the drinking water supplies which further increase the risk of cancer. 

taxes cause home farmers to go extinct. isn't it odd that they don't teach kids about home fruit and veg farming in schools? it's because they want good obedient workers who are likely to fight the oil wars for the tax kings. oh, the kid got poor marks in grade school? the kid might actually do well as a gardener, but no... forced into summer school... never to touch a garden and never knowing what good healthy quality soil actually looks like, feels like, and smells like.

* **walk or cycle whenever possible:**  i drive a small car just once every two weeks for a half-hour there and back to buy my groceries. i cycle to work and around town. i do as much as possible online and by phone to avoid having to drive to places (i think most of us do that nowadays)
* **travelling is a luxury:** i don't do travelling unless strictly necessary.
* **buy local:** i only buy imported produce when strictly necessary (e.g. i don't buy avocados, quinoa, etc)
* **reject packaging:** i buy mostly raw produce using my own reusable bags to reduce inorganic waste, and choose  products that come in minimal and recyclable or, better yet, biodegradable packaging (e.g. paper).
* **triple 'r':** i repair and reuse before i recycle, and then **r**ecycle before i discard.
* i use an electric fan instead of air conditioning in summer, and don't use heating during the winter, instead i wear thermal underwear which keeps me perfectly warm for free. i air dry my washing.
* **embrace minimalism and reject consumerism:** i don't buy useless low-quality products that don't add real value to my life or that of others. i don't engage in such bs as ""fast fashion"". i don't buy crappy useless gifts for other people, and ask people to do the same for me. i take into account the environmental effect of every product before i commit to purchasing it.
* **raise kids in an environmentally-friendly way:** currently i have no children and no immediate plans on having any, but if i ever do i'll ensure their environmental footprint is as small as possible, by teaching them my values and an appreciation for the environment. i would never acquire mounds of baby ~~crap~~ paraphernalia (mostly made of plastic and metal) and cheap brain-numbing quasi-disposable plastic toys for my kids like everyone seems to do. the sure alternative is to not have any children at all.

all that said, i don't think the responsibility for climate change lies with us ""end users"", but with governments and large corporations.  they are the enablers who give the gun to the monkey. they equip gullible, uninformed consumers, who don't have a birds-eye view of the environment, with the tools to pollute and tell us it's ok so that they can continue to satisfy their **addiction** to wealth and power. realistically us consumers have no way to gauge how their purchases will impact the environment, since most of the information we have access to has been manipulated to ensure the enablers can profit. there's no free lunch, and the environment always picks up the bill, quietly... until it explodes, and when it does, nobody will be held accountable. governments will just tell us ""you polluted too much, you should have known better"".

one final note, i think if humans had a lifespan of, say, 1000 years, we might be better at planning for this sort of thing. many people don't have any sense of responsibility because they know they'll be dead within the next 20-30 years and climate change won't affect them, for example, politicians. i think we are pretty screwed...",0.9819

0,"never attribute to climate change what can be attributed to stupidity in august 1955, connecticut was slammed with two back to back hurricanes. the flooding that resulted was nothing short of a catastrophe. a state report 3 months later totalled up the damage:

>668 dwellings were totally destroyed  
>  
>2,460 suffered major damage  
>  
>5,213 suffered minor damage  
>  
>507 ""industrial establishments' suffered $88.4 million in damage to buildings, machines, and materials  
>  
>1,436 commercial establishments suffered $45.5 million in damage  
>  
>922 farms reported losses of $2.5 million (not including damage to the land itself)  
>  
>public property damage was estimated at $36.8 million

in response to this, the army corps of engineers spent $70 million on flood control dams. the state also became stricter about development in flood plains. the area in waterbury on the west bank of the naugatuck river that had been washed away was never rebuilt, instead it was turned into the route 8 expressway. 

last month, germany was also slammed with horrible flooding. but unlike the nutmeg state's cool and composed response, the official word from the germans is to panic, saying the floods were the work of ~~god's wrath~~ climate change and that the only way to prevent future disasters is to ~~repent sins~~ cut carbon emissions. 

of course, if politicians didn't divert attention to climate change, i'm sure the public would pay much more attention to other more important factors, like lax restrictions on developing over wetlands. and that alone can make a big difference

in 1910, massachusetts had problems with flooding on the charles river, so they built a dam at its mouth between boston and cambridge. it kept flooding in check and as an added bonus, it created a freshwater reservoir.

but by 1970, the commonwealth noticed that floods had increased. the global temperature had only increased by .4 degrees celsius in those 60 years, so that couldn't be the reason. instead what had happened was urban sprawl had led to a dramatic increase in impermeable surfaces and all that water running off of rooftops and parking lots was overwhelming the charles. so, they had to build another, bigger dam downstream, which was finished in 1978.

so what are real solutions to flooding? it is mainly to remove the asphalt and cement barriers we've erected between rain and soil. houston recently started offering tax credits to developers that incorporate smart stormwater management systems and new orleans has gone further, requiring parking lanes and sidewalks on all new road projects to incorporate pervious pavement. 

other places have gotten even more creative. orange county, florida, home of orlando, recently passed a law giving legal rights to its waterways. it's now being used in a lawsuit against a developer who is trying to fill in wetlands and streams. and activists are pushing to add similar protections to the state constitution. 

i imagine that in the run up to the vote, developers will be running ads making excuses that floods are not caused by their paving over nature, but by... climate change.",0.0409
0,"moving house/ buying land as a preparatory measure i am considering my future with climate change in mind. specifically, i am wondering about where i live and how/ where i can move to prepare.

i currently live, with my wife and young son, in a town in the north of ireland. our town (elevation: 74m / 243feet) has three substantial rivers that converge in the centre of the town. at times of torrential rain, the river can & have burst their banks and flood the town (this is also true of the river that runs past the lowest part of our park - which has flooded as recently as 9 months ago). 

my question is, am i silly to be considering moving house - to not only keep my family safe in the future, but also to protect our largest asset (our house)?

if we were to move, will it be easier to cope with the symptoms of an ever changing climate somewhere more rural, on an elevated piece of land with renewable energy (wind and solar), with a small plot for growing our own food?

looking for a recent accounting of global carbon budget. i found some info from 2015 that says global uptake was on the order of 5 gigatons per year. i know there's been a tremendous amount of deforestation since then, and, that the ocean's role has increased.

what i'm trying to understand is an individual's own personal annual carbon ""budget"". knowing that everything adds in: electricity use, packaging, supply. if global co2 uptake were still 5 gigatons/yr, and there are 7.9 billion people in the world, an individual's ""share"" would be around 600 kg/yr.

is there a more recent accounting - i.e. how much has global uptake gone down in the last few years? (1) how much has this picture changed? (2) what am i not considering?

the problem with the world today is not something that can be summed in a page or two. these are highly interconnected and sophisticated adversities that lay ahead of our paths. understanding what we are in for and how we can help to prevent it is essential to not only the survival of our species, but also to the 40% of other species at risk of extinction. the topic of symbiosis is to say the least, brushed over in our high school textbooks; this is a quintessential failure on the education system and paradigm of our culture. we often take for granted the very soil that bears everything we avail, the web of life is dependent on that of other organisms. we tend to forget that through the course of evolution, those organisms that paired with mycelium and the fungal kingdom, were favoured by natural selection. the presence of such connections are the zenith of balance in an ecosystem, it is the intelligence that connects all life. the removal of biodiversity on our planet is more like a small house of cards than a web, this is an existential crisis. the intelligence of nature is undermined, and we must return to the wisdom of the planet. we must connect to mother earth and align our way of life to that of honouring our sacred symbiosis with her. in three generations, we have cut around 50% of the earth's forests, and replaced it with mega metropolises, agricultural facilities, and industrial wastelands. we mustn’t wait and experience the wrath of the tipping points, but become educated and evolve as a species. a massive storm is coming our way, whether we choose the path of societal paradigm shifts, or war, we must brace ourselves to change for a cause greater than our own; my vote goes to the planet. we have the capacity to change, to grow and evolve. we are in fertile times to discover how to live life as one with the planet. we have to take small steps, but start now. start educating yourself on natural systems. learn about the fungi and plants, and why we need the bees. we need massive societal shifts and we need to start implementing solutions now. we need to be the voice. we are the generation who will decide what happens to the rest of humanity. feel honoured to have a voice, because for the species of this planet who don’t, you can implement change. we can implement change. if we all work together for the greater good, we can build a better world, we can restore the archaic symbiosis that is the redeemer.",0.9841

realistically, we are not going to stop co2 emissions anytime soon. especially because of the economic slowdown, i wouldn't be surprised if we go back to square 1 in terms of co2 emissions prevention to ""recover economy"".  so,  let's say

&#x200b;

* **co2 emissions continue to grow and ultimately peak in around 2050.**
* **it'll take another 100 years to go to zero emissions(probably because there is no co2 based fuels)   (2150).**

**more importantly,** how would we humans need to adapt? what new skills will be important? will government, nations, and societies still exist? or could a new world order arise? can the earth support half, or even quarter of it's lifeforms(and humans)? what will happen to our science, like medicine, standard of living etc?

will earth become completely inhabitable and maybe mars like? will our space program and atomic program no longer be useful? also, if science it still developing at any pace, even after thousands of years, will we ever be able to get tech to the level of re-terraforming our earth? or will it happen naturally? or never?

what new energy will our people use, after all the oil is burned up? will renewable energy now be the cheapest? or will nuclear powered cities arise like in some sci-fi movie?

&#x200b;

started coming off a medication called amitriptyline in december last year, at half the speed advised by my doctor (was knocking off about an eighth of the dose every two weeks instead of a quarter).

&#x200b;

it was all going pretty well until february, where my nervous system basically blew up in the space of a few days. started waking up super early and feeling restless, and instead of its usual relaxing effects, exercising made things worse. my nervous system was just completely over sensitive to everything. 

&#x200b;

under the doctor's orders, i went back up from 25mg to 35mg, then to 50mg, then 60mg and 75mg (more than what i was taking originally): it didn't work and i think it even made it worse.

&#x200b;

now 6 months later and i have a range of neurological symptoms: i constantly feel startled (which i never had before since i took the med for sleep only), vertigo, tingling sensation in my legs, hyper alertness, hands sweating for no reason. it comes in waves. i've had a quite a few windows of a few days where i felt better which always end in me waking up and feeling shit again, just as i thought i was getting better. 

&#x200b;

more than the actual intensity of the symptoms, it's the length of them that worries me. the first month i told myself it was normal to experience withdrawal when coming off amt. after i reinstated, i thought it make take some weeks for things to improve. but 4 months into the reinstatement and not really feeling any better for it - well i feel like it could just go on for ever. 

&#x200b;

there are different frustrating aspects:

&#x200b;

1/ i ended up here because of doctors who didn't have a clue what they were doing. it took me the best part of 20mins on google to find out about protracted withdrawal from anti depressants, and new official advice to taper by a max of 10% every month - something my first two psychiatrists and gp didn't warn me about at all.

&#x200b;

2/ being told by a doctor: we don't really know why it happened or what's going on, we don't really know when it will get better and we don't know if you'll make a full recovery. the world of chronic illness / impairment really is a bitch

&#x200b;

3/ the windows and wave patterns. every time i feel better for a few days, hope kicks in, i start messaging my friends, looking forwards to things like birthday celebrations... and every time so far it's been a cold shower. getting used to seeing my quality of life being sept away hurts as much as the first time, every time. and it's been around ten times now. it would be so much easier to deal with if it was a linear progression to get better. 

&#x200b;

overall i've had to completely change who i am for this - and it's just not for the better. can't drink alcohol, can't do any  proper exercise other than walking. reduced social circle to its minimum required of about 5-10 people. i'm about 10,000 miles away from the rest of my family and hotel quarantines are three weeks so  spending 21 days in isolation in my current state. 

&#x200b;

still i find a couple of slight positive changes: my sleep has very much improved (almost normal). my hyper alertness has not been relentless like it was at some point (but the feeling of being startled, which i didn't have before increasing the dose in medication, feels like torture). my concentration and memory are also back to normal. just writing this puts a smile on my face.

tbh, i feel like amongst my friends, even my partner at times, i am chicken little saying the sky is falling. i am not even suggesting doomsday prepping (though i think there is wisdom in that) but long term life investments and plan making like michigan being a more profitable place for real estate in 20-30 years, preparing for water prices to increase, solar panels, etc. i am becoming increasingly frustrated because few are listening and i can’t find any personal advice from any others besides online. 

it seems there is magical calvary coming to save us. we are past stopping the train, it’s now about triage as best we can (right?).

at this rate, it seems scientifically the most drastic changes will be in a decade, maybe two. though, of course, we will see significant changes within a year (as we already are seeing). please kindly correct me if this is wrong (and with scientific evidence or a link please).

with all this being said, as an advertising major, i have noticed we hardly ever see advertising with the opposite message. ""vote for politicians that are serious about climate."" ""no one is immune"" ""reduce waste by living a more simple life"" etc.

we know that most of the world is heavily influenced by advertising and pop culture, yet very little is spent to send the message that the world needs to get serious about this topic. i feel like putting the problem in front of people's faces every day with solutions, as well as exposing those who are the worst climate offenders could at least sway people enough to consider climate change when voting. we all know that any real action depends on changes in policy, not what any one or group of individuals can do.

is there anyone here that would be interested in exploring a non-profit organization dedicated to raising funds for environmental awareness/advertising? or is anyone aware of an organization like this that is already in place? i have searched online but to no avail.",-0.7236

0,"change my mind if you can, if you fail it makes my argument stronger **climate change**

&#x200b;

 i am willing to change my beliefs on this controversial issue, but currently i do not believe climate change is linked to humans

&#x200b;

**increase in carbon and global warming theory**

&#x200b;

the natural release of carbon into the atmosphere, there is graphs you can find which date the density of carbon, and you can see that carbon goes up after the increase of temperature. we are near the top but still on the rise. the graph seems to explain most of the climate 'crisis.' 

global warming theory explains the fall of the graph where carbon is affected by heat, but not 70 percent of it. 

&#x200b;

**ice caps**

&#x200b;

for the majority of earths history theres been no ice caps, and we've been perfectly fine.  if you say that melting ice will rise the sea levels, no. ice will displace the same amount as its liquid form, as it holds the same mass. if ice affected sea levels there would have to be some magical way for matter to be created, which as you'll know, is literally impossible. furthermore, as the ice melts on greenland, what is it revealing? farms from the ancient warm period. you know, that period of time climate scientists dont talk about? where no one was driving around in diesel cars, and everyone was eating a plant based diet, and factories didnt exist? but the earth was still hotter than it is today and there was barely a north and south pole? yeah that period

&#x200b;

**possible explanation for gwts popularity**

&#x200b;

as any scientist would i am willing to change my opinion if i am provided with facts that oppose what i have found, but mostly people are incapable of finding evidence against my theory. the sterling report opens with 'the evidence for this is overwhelming' but oddly fails to show any...  the ipcc has had over 30 years to find significant evidence supporting gwt. it is often that reports will beat around the bush and never say any results backing their claims, and what they do show is easily debunkable. 

condensed water is the largest greenhouse gas which greatly complicates things.

furthermore, i when papers are peer reviewed, it often would make sense for the reviewers to lie. if they say this isnt right to a report on climate change, that wouldnt work for a university to publish, people dont want to hear that, and so the reviewer wont do that in fear of losing their job.

2) as someone who’s just started heavily paying attention to climate change recently, has 2020 and 2021 seen a truly unprecedented spike in heatwaves, fires, floods and overall just disasters or am i just seeing it more because i’ve been paying closer attention? it feels like this year and the last couple we are really truly seeing how our future will be. 

3) i seen a map by parag khanna illustrating the future of our planet if the temperature warms to 4c but i am curious, is that map an indicator as to how it will look by the time we hit 4c warming or that’s how it will begin to play out after that point? it’s crazy to see a lot of the world would be desert. 

4) as we see more disasters take place resulting in mass migration, how do you think countries will approach this? will we see countries just let those in horrible situations die or will we see countries take in massive amounts of migrants potentially destabilizing their own country?

5) do you guys think it’s realistic that we could only see 2c of warming or is that at this point just totally unrealistic given the track we are on??

0,"pleasant experience was on vacation this past week and the rental company stuck me in a hybrid toyota rav4. it was actually a pleasant experience and has me interested in purchasing a hybrid for my next vehicle if not a total electric car. 

having said that i'm a little skeptical of climate change. by skeptical i don't mean that i do not believe it is happening i just wonder about the percentage of contribution by mankind and how big of an effect it will have combating it. seems to me no matter what we do we are on the eventual path of climate change anyway. that doesn't mean i feel we should throw our hands up in the air and forget any attempt to correct it. however, as a conservative, i believe we need more climate change advocates that lead by example and not just by verbal language. 

for instance the people in hollywood who i think are a bunch of clowns own huge mansions private jets private yachts- they preach to people about sacrifice and saving the planet yet they live luxurious energy wasting lifestyles that most of us will never experience. in addition, to make the movies that they sell to us must waste the equivalent of providing energy for a whole town for months on end. their films require transportation for all film members actors supporting cast supporting staff, living quarters, post-production processes that involve high intense computer work, and much more. 

next the politicians - is it really necessary to have these meetings halfway around the world many of them using private transportation to get there , staying in lavish hotels, and all the other wasteful energy consumption they do to have these meetings. it's not necessary. having a zoom meeting would be just as effective. they're preaching to us about the changes we need to make without really making any of the sacrifices themselves. 

we need a reasonable approach without the extremists from both sides. the idea that we would be totally electric in a decade is not realistic.  air transportation alone will need to stay with fossil fuels for quite some time. i know i wouldn't feel comfortable in an electric jet until it's had quite a long time of research , development and trials. 

plenty of conservatives i know are behind the idea of addressing climate change and/or pollution. to attract even more i think we need to get away from the overused and redundant verbiage that constantly comes from the media- existential threat being the number one offense. stop it already. it's an important issue that needs to be addressed and as i mentioned before reasonable solutions should be enforced. the extremist calling for us to do away with eating natural meat and switching over to lab grown meat, that's just insane to me and you're going to lose a lot of people with just that solution alone. stay focused on electric vehicles which we have been. work on carbon capture so we can have something to help while we are implementing this changeover and allow time for more solutions to come to the table.  we can attain a smoother, less interruptive transition with this method. 

as for me, i have changed all my windows in my house to double pane, led lighting, fuel efficient car, efficient washer and dryer, i keep my ac at 80 while i'm not home. i used to collect the shower water with a bucket while it was heating up and use that water to flush the toilet however my wife got sick of the bucket being in the in the shower.. haha

0,"electric cars being treated as a panacea? i like in the uk, and it seems that not a day goes by without there being some mention of electric cars on the news. they seem to be the main focus of both policy and the media's attention. this makes sense given quite how many motorists there are and how it's become the dominant mode of transport over the last few decades. there is other mention of industrial strategy and decarbonising the energy grid, for instance, but getting people to swap their petrol/diesel cars for electric/hybrid seems to be the main aim. 

the thing is, i've only heard one person mention that swapping over to electric cars has a huge environmental cost. it seems to me that, as if often the case with issues like climate change, a simple solution is being applied to an incredibly complex issue. sure, everyone having an electric car would be good for air quality and that's by no means a bad thing, and it would also reduce the uk's carbon emissions significantly. but what about the resources needed to build the electric cars? from what i understand, mining lithium alone is an incredibly environmentally damaging process. on top of that you've got all the other aspects of building a car. it seems, at times, like the climate crisis is being discussed in isolation with no mention of the ecological crisis. clearly both are one and the same, but it often doesn't seem that way when you listen to debates on the radio. 

am i missing something here though? is it actually a lot less environmentally damaging to build a car than i think. have car manufacturers made the process a lot greener? would the benefits of everyone switching to electric cars by 2040 outweigh any environmental costs of doing so? or is it just another weak capitalist solution to an issue capitalism created. in other words, it's great because car companies get to sell more cars, but in actual fact the point is that there should be more investment in public transport and people should buy cars less frequently and keep the car they have a lot longer. also, it just seems like it'd be outsourcing carbon emissions/environment degradation to countries where the raw materials for building cars are mined.

0,"(article) - ""the age of the great dying is beginning"" - is this author's predictions true? are we doomed? dark, dark thoughts echo in my mind these days. as reluctant as i am to share them with you, perhaps i also have a certain responsibility to. this one — and i don’t recommend you read this essay if you’re at all feeling anxious or depressed — goes like this.

here’s the way that i think about the future — don’t worry, this isn’t the thought itself, just the context. the 30s are going to be the decade of global warming (aka “climate change”) turning catastrophic. megafire, megaflood, megatyphoon, “heat domes” — all these will replace the gentle seasons as we once thought of them. the 40s, the decade when mass extinction — already accelerating — begins to upend the basic systems of our civilization. and the 50s will be the decade of the final goodbye — when our civilisation’s systems simply crash and come to a halt, food, air, water, medicine, all in short supply, because we cannot produce them anymore, having killed the living planet.

that much you should already be able to feel. in the searing temperatures of the twin heat domes still covering much of the planet. in the way that much of the planet can’t get vaccines for a new plague. or the way that a new plague is simply being left to breed new variants, each more infectious and deadly than the last.

what i’ve described to you is a set of megatrends. but beneath them runs another one, perhaps the grimmest of all.

the age of the great dying has begun.

i know that sounds grandiose, melodramatic, and faintly ridiculous. i don’t want it to be true, and i don’t write it for hyperbole’s sake. let me simply present you with some facts that will explain what i mean — and leave you, probably, as chilled as i am.

a grim threshold was recently crossed. 4 million people around the world are now dead of covid. how many people is that? more than in all the wars in the last half century or so. it’s nearly the population of a country like denmark. it’s a staggering number. and it’s only just the beginning. let me come back to it, though. for now, let’s call it 5 million, because even epidemiologists will agree it’s certainly a dramatic underestimate.

another such line was crossed, too. extreme temperatures now kill more than 5 million people a year. that number, too, is going to rise dramatically, because we’re only at the very beginning of a trend of runaway warming.

put those together, and you already have 10 million people dead. in the last year or so. from a new pandemic, and from a warming planet. ten million people.

how many is that? it’s more than the populations of denmark and new zealand. more than the population of new york city or london.

let me say it again. already — in this past year or so — ten million people are dead. of things that did not exist a few years ago. a new pandemic, and a warming planet. more people are already dead from the new catastrophes we’ve made than make up entire countries.

maybe now you see a little bit what i mean by this especially grim term “the age of the great dying.” still think it’s hyperbole, exaggeration, overstatement? (maybe you do, if you’re a certain kind of privileged white american. so try imagining being the families of one of those ten million people who are already dead.)

ten million dead and counting. i want you to reflect on that and think about it carefully. did you know? why didn’t you? what does it mean? should you be indifferent to it? is your ignorance manufactured for the benefit of elites, perhaps?

ten million dead in one year from covid and global warming. that’s how staggeringly fast what i’ve called “the age of the great dying” is happening.

the crucial questions are: how many more will there be, and how fast?

the answers are not good. covid is going endemic. nobody cares about vaccinating the world, except a handful of doctors and scientists. rich westerners couldn't care less, so their governments don’t care, so covid’s exploding worldwide. you know the story: new variants emerge, that are vaccine resistant, and everybody’s at risk from them, even in the rich west. covid is becoming a new plague — it’s not just a pandemic anymore, a thing that goes away after a couple of years.

all that’s confirmed by the fact that the trend is accelerating. see that chart above? this last year or two’s 4 million deaths are just a beginning. the curve is bending upwards. that’s an ominous, horrific line to see. it hasn’t even hit an inflection point yet. the exponent is still growing. that means, in hard terms, we should expect to see double that number every year or two. 8 million? 16 million? 32 million? all these are very, very real possibilities.

but covid’s not the only game of death in town.

warming’s already killed five million people this year, roughly. we hear about the small catastrophes — a few hundred dead in canada, another few in california, and so on. of course those deaths are terrible and tragic and they matter. but the number of excess deaths ascribe to extreme temperatures far, far exceeds those. people simply dropping dead of heatstrokes, heart attacks, strokes, pulmonary issues, asthma attacks, and so on. that’s how you get five million dead of extreme heat already.

you can see that this summer is severely, severely abnormal. it’s shattered even the worst predictions. the twin heat domes lingering over the planet made parts of canada as hot as the hottest place on earth, jacobabad, pakistan. the heat is off the charts almost everywhere on the planet. take a look, for example, at this picture of planet earth.

warming has only just begun. we’re already at five million dead a year. the temperature has barely even risen one full degree yet. we’re on course to hit four degrees or more. and every degree the temperature rises — the global mean — deaths will occur probably at exponentially greater rates. barely hitting one degree puts us at five million deaths per year. two? probably easily an order of magnitude greater than that — fifty. three? five hundred. four? let’s not even go there.

if you don’t get why, just imagine how badly our civilisation is going to break. just one degree of warming and canada’s on fire. now imagine two. still think that power grid is going to supply the air conditioning that keeps you comfortable? who’s going to be able to live in places like las vegas and california — or india, pakistan, iran, and, well, much of the planet? at three, the planet’s tropics have become fire belts, and societies simply stop working, as climate refugees flee by the millions, and even in survivable cities, simply going outside is taking your life into your own hands. and i haven’t even mentioned wet bulb temperature yet, which means: it’s impossible for you to survive, period.

put just those two catastrophes together — global warming and covid — and you have exponentially rising death rates over the foreseeable future. we hit ten million dead a year — snap — just like that, faster than you probably believed could happen. but that number is easily going to rise far, far higher — twenty, fifty, a hundred — faster than you can believe, too.

the human mind does not do well with exponential growth, and it doesn’t do well with death. that’s why most of us are in a desperately feigned indifference. addicted to our dumb selfies and reality tv and violence and porn and consumerism harder than ever. we are trying, rather pathetically, to deny what’s right in front of our eyes.

the staggering toll of the catastrophes we face is not set in some distant, remote future. it is beginning to happen right here, right now.

the age of the great dying has begun.

it’s not a joke, and it’s not a drill. if we were a saner kind of being than the vicious, greedy, domineering, hierarchically submissive primates we are — we might even care more. enough to stop it. as it is, though, you can see another trend, hidden beneath the mass graves of the dead of this new dark age.

0,"want to know what happens in a. hundred years? read this came across the wiki page for the easter island, off the chilean coast in the south pacific:

&#x200b;

*archeological record shows that at the time of the initial settlement the island was home to many species of trees, including at least three species which grew up to 15 metres (49 ft) or more. at least six species of land birds were known to live on the island. barbara a. west wrote, ""sometime before the arrival of europeans on easter island, the rapanui experienced a tremendous upheaval in their social system brought about by a change in their island's ecology... by the time of european arrival in 1722, the island's population had dropped to 2,000–3,000 from a high of approximately 15,000 just a century earlier.""*  


*by that time, 21 species of trees and all species of land birds became extinct through some combination of over-harvesting, over-hunting, rat predation, and climate change. the island was largely deforested, and it did not have any trees taller than 3 m (9.8 ft). loss of large trees meant that residents were no longer able to build seaworthy vessels, significantly diminishing their fishing abilities. one theory is that the trees were used as rollers to move the statues to their place of erection from the quarry at deforestation also caused erosion which caused a sharp decline in agricultural production. this was exacerbated by the loss of land birds and the collapse in seabird populations as a source of food.*   


*as the island became overpopulated and resources diminished, warriors known as matatoa gained more power and the ancestor cult ended, making way for the bird man cult. beverly haun wrote, ""the concept of mana (power) invested in hereditary leaders was recast into the person of the birdman, apparently beginning circa 1540, and coinciding with the final vestiges of the moai period."" this cult maintained that, although the ancestors still provided for their descendants, the medium through which the living could contact the dead was no longer statues but human beings chosen through a* ***competition.***  


competition here results in strength and fighting tournaments.

basically, once humans exhausted the island's natural resources, population dropped 80% in a century, violence erupted and the survival of the fittest kicked in and violent leaders took hold of power.  
and the fact that they were still cutting down the large remaining trees to use as rollers for their stone statues... could there be a better metaphor for our obsession with status quo?

&#x200b;

i think this holds a lot of the keys to the future.

&#x200b;

climate change works on a delayed exponential model: due to climate inertia, there is a lag between emissions and temperature increase. that's just like covid where there is a lag between deaths and exponential rise in cases.

&#x200b;

with covid, for every wave, people used the same arguments to whine about lockdown measures: 'cases are only 30k, and deaths are super low!'. little did they know that mathematically, the slaughter was already a done deal. if people can't see it happening by taking a look out of their window, they refuse to believe it. they rely on hope, god or karma to sort things out so that it all takes a turn for th best.

this makes me wonder whether a similar approach applies to wooden furniture (or indeed houses). 
apart from it being renewable/biodegradable and not having too harmful a production process, would an increased demand for wood lead to an increase in artificial woodlands?  (and possibly the turnover. it seems we still don't know if it's more useful to keep trees alive than to replace them with new ones)
or would it just lead to the destruction of the little forest cover we have left in developing nations? (just as bitcoin seems to be burning more fossil fuels than accelerating the growth of renewable energy infrastructure)

perhaps a bonus question: does anyone appreciate this capitalist approach? or do you take it with the same skepticism trickle-down economics has recently been receiving? else how do i get to see their side of things?",0.9728

is fashion being used to obsolete things. if i buy a piece of clothing today, in 2 or 3 years it is out of fashion. 

example: in the 90s, people fitted coloured bathroom suites. it was all the rage.  pink, beige, peach, green bathroom suite....  people got rid of their white bathroom suites and fitted coloured ones. what was in fashion in lates 80s and 90s, was out of fashion by 2000. when people are reverting back to white bathtub. 

what is the carbon cost of making things obsolete by design? is it worth sticking to classic designs which never go out of fashion??

i went to my local refuse tip, to put items in recycling. i looked into the pottery sections, i was horrified to see the amount of perfect good bathroom suite being thrown away. these were in white,  but were old victorian style designs.  most likely people changing them to  modern designs. i suspect, they design industry will come up with something different to entice people to change to something else....

0,"idea about ocean fertilization i've had this idea a few years ago and i'm hoping to get some feedback.

so assuming we need to reduce atmospheric co2. what has the greatest surface area exposed to air? the ocean. what contributes to 1/5 of all photosynthesis on earth? it's the diatom.

so the obvious way is to boost diatom growth. and according to wikipedia, 

>  in iron deficient conditions each atom of iron can fix 106,000 atoms of carbon. 

where do we get the iron? my proposal is : we get it from the saharan desert or the namibian desert.

basically we build solar plants on the west coast of africa, with the electricity we can do a few things : 

1. transport the sand from the desert to the plant.
2. electrolyze the seawater to produce naoh and cl2
3. use the naoh and chlorine to process the sand and extract the iron content into fecl3, which is soluble as algae fertilizer. there will also be soluble silicon byproducts (waterglass) to provide nutrients for the diatoms to grow their silica shells.
4. perhaps excess naoh could be used to reduce acidity of the seawater to improve co2 solubility.

now in the west coast the ocean current is uprising and will bring nutrients up to the surface, by fertilizing with iron there'd be an algal bloom. some algae will die off and sink to the ocean floor where the carbon will be stored for thousands of years. some algae will be eaten and go into the food chain. 

the diatom is the perfect feedstock for mussels. we will farm the mussels on ocean (profit), and the mussels themselves also sequester co2 into their shells (made from caco3), which we also dump into the ocean.

desert sand is unlimited and free, electrolysis plants require some maintenance but i think it's not much.  and, at least there's a use for all the sand that we don't know how to deal with. personally i think the plan will work in any west cost so california or perth or chile are ideal places to experiment with, but west africa has the most abundant stockpile of sand.",0.9237

0,"to reverse climate change a scientifically valid, tangible and practical way to begin reversing climate change.  

plant plants. as many as any plot of land can hold. the faster growing and and woodier stemed plants are best for capturing co2. 

grass in not effective at removing large quantities of co2. so i recommend we turn every plot of grass into a plot of diverse trees and shrubs. grass does not hold on to rain water and is easily destroyed opening the soil up to sun exposure which sterilizes the microbes.

on land already degraded we would till or mix in compost plant ground covers to protect it then plant larger beings for the longterm reversal of the co2 heat retention effects. reducing heat sinks and waves.


reducing the heat increases moisture in the air allowing for rains, in now more desert-forming like climates, to return. 

it will take a couple years, maybe five if you did the planting quickly. a lot of artificial watering would need to occur but less and less as the smaller shrubs and ground cover became established. 

i live in the seattle metropolitan area that was a temperate rainforest year round. it is now taking on the appearance of a hot dry and arid landscape with increasing lower yields of rainfall. 

i can literally see desertification happening on every block. barren ground is desertification. soils continue to degrade and more plants go away. furthering the degradation cycle. 

if we dont start planting more plants or working towards them getting in the ground we are actively hurting every day just by existing. 

lets face it. stopping our co2 emissions is not practical and every effort that takes money away from rebuilding the earths soils and biomes through planting of plants is a farce and a distraction.

i want to live and its not looking good. think, 5 years of heavy planting, could neutralize a lot of what were seeing. another 5, and maybe even a complete reversal

i am disheartened by my family’s unwillingness to change and prepare for what’s to come. i am in a family group chat and i send them articles daily on what’s happening in the world in regards to climate change. it has gotten to the point now where they all rather not discuss it anymore and kicked me out the group chat… my own family.

one of my close relatives told me they are sick of me posting it and telling them to prepare. i am avid about this entire subject because **we are living in it right now** and want all my loved ones to be informed. but every one of them rather continue with their *ignorance* and pretend to understand the ramifications of climate change today and the future.

i have now been shunned out of the group and they all have basically “blocked” me from texting them until i “bring positivity” and not speak of it basically. i can’t do that. this is literally leading to doomsday for humanity.

if i can prepare, why not my family also? why would they look at someone who’s trying to save them and advise a plan as being an annoyance?

i am saddened and i just can’t bare with their ignorance. they are part of the problem in ignoring climate change and increasing the adverse effects of it. i have been knowledgeable and posted on this subject for a decade. dreams of horrific storms that causes thousands of deaths for years that stick with me. i cannot let this happen to my family and now they have rejected me because i’m “too negative”… i am not negative. i still have hope, but i cannot be positive when they are living in areas that will be significantly impacted by climate change than where i am… they will be immersed in earth’s tears. hurricanes are devastating their areas more and more yet want to ignore the facts i am presenting…

i’m 22 y/o, and already i feel as though there is little to no point in continuing life. by no means am i suicidal or anything like that, but i find myself filled with despair, a despair which has only worsened in these past several weeks. climate change is the number one thing on my mind, and the number one influencer of my decisions, almost all the time. i can’t escape it, and can feel it actively making me a jaded and pessimistic person. 

as i prepare for the future of my life post-college, i am finding enormous difficulty in giving a damn about anything. in my job search i am trying to be conscious about where i end up applying to regionally, not because it’s where i want to go but because it may allow me to live longer once shit hits the fan. i am finding myself consumed with bitter thoughts, seeing building developments under construction and wondering why they are even doing it when soon none of it’s going to matter. i have begun to plan a life of self sustainability, living off the land and whatnot, but fear i won’t have enough time to get my life in order and make enough money to make this happen. i have already accepted the reality that i cannot have children without damning them to an incredibly difficult life.

worst of all is the fact that nobody else in my life seems to care. it’s not that i’m surrounded by deniers, but rather by people who know what is happening and yet continue on living business as usual. when i try to talk to them about the true extent of the damage to come, they tell me i’m too pessimistic and that there is still time to stop climate change. i don’t believe that, but i do believe there’s still time to adapt to it. 

i worry that i am growing disassociated with society and the ones closest to me in my own life. i channel my worry through unhealthy coping mechanisms, justifying them to myself by saying that it won’t matter in a decade or two from now when shit has really hit the fan. i feel as though i’m going crazy when i’m considering that these thoughts disassociate me from society, when in actuality i believe society is disassociated from the truth of our situation because it is too difficult to think about. i seriously just don’t know how to cope with these things. i’ll continue my job search and try to live a “normal life”, but i can’t shake the feeling that it’s all for nothing and that i’d be better off spending this time just doing whatever i want, even if it costs me all i own. i’m too young to have already given up on life, but i don’t really want to be around for too much longer and that’s the truth i cannot get past",-0.9951

it's funny how here nobody denies global warming, the only deniers i ever met were online and once a professor here obviously being paid to miseducate scholars (shock: back in 2019!) but that's because the whole government policy in brazil right now is of denial and anti-environmentalism. imagine our president to be trump on steroids and without a leash.
well, anyways, one of the reasons i usually sob about, is how in my early 20s me and my friends could already tell there's been a significant warming from what we remember in our lives already. but growing up here all i heard from adults was how much hotter and drier everything was and the elderly had even more stories that today sounds like fairy tale.
from my childhood until today (i'm 26), the climate in the city i live in, went from being classified as highland tropical (cwb) and is now tropical (aw).
the climate here is a monsoon-like type of climate: during summer, the amazon humidity makes an u-turn by the andes slopes and towards south/southeastern brazil, with one the peaks of rainfall being where i live: 290mm (11.4in) november, 360mm (14in) december, 320mm (12.6in) january, with a smooth transition to dry season, peaking in august (also winter/cool season). summers were mildly warm from the extra humidity combined with the elevation of 850m on average, where i live it's more around 930m and the higher neighborhoods here reach 1200m. winters were cool and dry but varying from year to year specially due to el niño/neutrality/la niña (pacific water temperatures) strong influence on this region's climate patterns.
well it was a sort of inversed mediterranean climate, with rainy summer and dry winter, the rainy summer making it never too hot and mild the whole year, a region known for its mildness although locals always felt hot in summer and cold in winter. it even frosted often times here past century, the last time being 1985 downtown at 3.5°c (idk why but in brazil it can and will frost at anything below 4°c!!!). today the lowest we get in the same region, which also grew in size and became a bigger heat island, is around 12°c.
phenomena like fog and very cold mornings (around 5°c) completely vanished from my childhood and teens until today. the average air humidity which was rarely below 40% during dry season today is below 30% almost everyday and reaches extremely low values of around 12%. then it comes october, the worst month of the year.
until i was a teen, october was a smooth transition from dry to rainy weather: the slight and natural increase in humidity from the warming up atmosphere made it easier for cool humid air to reach us from antarctica (during winter it's usually cool dry air) bringing the lowest highs of the year, around 14°c and 15°c and rainy afternoons a few times a month but also hot convection summer showers around 30°c. this was a region known for not surpassing the 30°c mark too many times a year, even tho the average high in the warmest month was 28°c, we usually stay very close to our averages with less abrupt shifts like in higher lattitudes.  so then
today's october is a hell on earth. there was a sudden shift 8-9 years ago, around 2012, when october's suddenly became very dry and hot! kind of like the pacific west coast's summer is today. the  all time high here kept at 36°c once in 110 years of measurement, last year we were 36°c in september for a week and then again in october for about 10 days. many brazilian cities shattered their all time highs by 4 to 6°c and kept repeating those highs for many days in a row. it was insane.
it's been somewhat like that every october since 2012 or so, never again it was mild.
winters used to bring, on the coolest days, sunny afternoons with highs between 15°c and 20°c, lows between 5°c and 10°c, (in my lifetime) but now those are not even the coldest days in the year. oh yeah, from a place used not to getting above 30°c above a lot, our ""monsoon"" became weaker which meant more sunny days during summer and now being above 30°c everyday in summer is the rule.
brace yourselves! what i observed from this insanity in climate change, specially warming and drying here, shows me that there was a tipping point: when new scandalous weather patterns suddenly appeared -after showing slow signs during the past decades- and came to stay. here we are just adapting to feeling hot most of the year, it's quite an abrupt feeling for those who were once spoiled by very mild weather, older houses here even have chymneys and everything was built to let more sun indoors, now everyone hates the sun we want to hide in the shade.

0,"high and low temperatures in nc 1946, 1973, 2018, 2020 back in 2019 i finished crocheting a temperature blanket that showed the high and low temperatures for every day in johnston county north carolina in 2018 and 1973 (my birth year). i made a color chart in photoshop of both years (center circle is lows, outer square is highs), and after the project was done i decided to add two more years to the chart: 2020 and 1946 (the furthest back the local weather station had a record of the highs and lows for the area).

first impression: nc has always had crazy weather, and it's fun to see that in color. we get punishing heat for weeks at a time in the summer, but sometimes jumping from high sixties/low seventies to below-freezing and back in the space of a few days in january, and random 80-degree days in march. 2018 was particularly crazy; we had a full week in the first of the year where the temperature never got much above freezing (which never happens), and those three days in a row of solid yellow in september 2018 were when hurricane florence was causing catastrophic flooding (this was less than two years after hurricane matthew caused catastrophic flooding, and not much was done to improve the flood-prone areas afterward because ""this kind of storm only hits every hundred years or so."") 

the number of days where the highs were over 91 degrees has doubled since 1946, but that doesn't really tell us much, since 1973 had more 91+ days than 2020.

one thing that stands out to me are the squares with a yellow center. those are the days when the temperature never dropped below 73 degrees, even in the middle of the night. that didn't happen at all in 1946 or 1973, but it happened 23 times in 2018 and then 35 times in 2020. that to me feels scarier than the 91+ degree days, because it means we're not getting as much relief from the heat, and it seems to be getting worse.

i know four points over just 75 years aren't enough to prove anything, but i'd love to see these charts for other areas of the world to see if people can see a similar effect.",-0.5574

having read about vertical farming before, i checked out some articles and sources and it has been suggested it can be up to 600x more efficient than traditional crop growth.

so now, only 0.00028 acres of land is needed per vegan. multiplied by the uk population, that’s 18514 acres. seems like a lot of vertical farms to build? well the tesla gigs factory is 126 acres, so it’s less that 150 of those. 

this is in comparison to the 23 million acres currently used for agriculture in the uk. 

benefits include growing crops year round, being able to grow produce not native to the location, disease and weather resistance, as well as returning farming land to natural habitats for wildlife. 

i know the whole of the uk isn’t going vegan anytime soon, and i also appreciate the numbers maybe a “best case” scenario, but why is there not a bigger push for this? why isn’t it being done on a larger scale? why are governments not seeing it as an easy win?

0,"why wouldn't this work ? i recently watched the pbs / nova program ""can we cool the planet"". it reminded me of a question i have had for a long time. i have an idea for fighting global warming that could work in real, practical terms. (not technology theory) i was hoping that it might be mentioned. sadly, it was not.

whenever i attend a live science lecture involving any climate change topic, i ask the lecturer why this wouldn't work. i have yet to hear a real answer. most often, they say, ""well, you would have to do the calculations."" that, to me, translates to ""i don't know."" but it also seems to translate to, ""i never heard that idea before."" 

i find it difficult to believe that my idea is so original that it has never been considered. it seem far more reasonable to me to conclude that my idea has glaring flaws that puts it outside the boundaries of a serious proposal. but i don't know what those flaws are. i'm hoping someone here can point them out to me.

before jumping right into the idea, consider this ""axiom"". fundamentally, climate change is a social problem, not a technology problem. there are a lot of technology solutions (and non-technical solutions) that would help a lot if society would just get behind them and implement them. that's a social problem. whatever we do, it has to be something that can be implemented in human society.

here's the idea:

people who post here are familiar with solar power plants that collect and concentrate sunlight to produce the high temperature heat needed to generate electricity. these often use mirrors focused on a central core. i started to wonder just how efficient these are since some of the solar radiation reflected from the mirrors had to miss the core and then go back out into space. once that thought occurred to me, my next thought was, ""that's a good thing! the greenhouse effect happens because the solar radiation is converted into infrared radiation that is then trapped in the atmosphere."" the thought after that was, ""if solar power plants became the method of power generation, it could impact the entire albedo of the earth.""

increasing albedo is actually the main idea behind encouraging white roofs in california and solar geoengineering in general. it just seems to me that power generation through reflective solar power plants could be a more efficient way to do it.

anything can be accomplished if you make it profitable. in this case, all we would have to do is get a new tax incentive passed. we wouldn't have to invent new technology to spray pixie dust into the stratosphere or orbit mirrors. just give this specific method of power generation a tax break big enough to make it more profitable than other methods. like magic, reflection power plants would sprout like weeds after a wet spring. if it could work and certain powerful political people were convinced of that, it could be passed. 

having more power generated with solar plants would be a good thing anyway. but if there is a bonus of increasing earth's albedo as well ... i just don't see why that wouldn't push it to the front of the line.",0.9953

**hitherto:**   our summers are pretty hot already and it would not be an exaggeration in the least to say that most of the rich urban population **would not be able to live comfortably without air conditioning for >8 hours as of now**. for instance, (i'm aware that this is bad for the environment) i wake up at around 8 amish and my air conditioner runs till 2 am the next day, i usually keep it at 18 degree c. i have tried reducing my usage but in months like may even this amount of usage doesn't suffice and i often leave a shadow of sweat on my bed when i wake up. 

i have even experienced a 40 degree celsius summer once and have gone through multiple droughts where even the creme of the city had to rely on water cans. our wells dried up and we dig our bore-wells deeper and deeper every year.  the metropolitan water supply failed and the whole city went to a major water crisis. 

**what i'd like to know:** how bad will the situation be in the near future

most of my close ones (around my age group) will very likely emigrate to the states in a few years. this well is not cause of climate change but it is pretty well not unusual cause of job opportunities in cs. but usa's political climate is more uncertain than its geological climate lol and i don't know if we won't be kicked out incase of a refugee crisis *(//would appreciate thoughts on this too. which countries would be the best to immigrate to; what are the chances that usa will kick out immigrants who move by the next 3-5 years if a crisis occurs in the near future)* 

now if you had noticed, the last paragraph has a major caveat. only those around my age group and around my socio economic status will be lucky enough to migrate. i'm concerned about what is to happen to the country as a whole. or tbh to my immediate family. will my parents be able to live comfortably in india for another 30-50 years? given that we are considerably well to do (not creme or multimillionaires). or should i actually start considering moving them to a habitable place too.

how do we know how much does the co2 have an effect on earth's atmosphere (and the temperature) ?

let me elaborate. i had to narrow down my question to be more specific. co2 levels are rising, humans are responsible, i do get that. i also understand the experiment in the lab with co2 and the tube and increased temperature. but that is in the lab and in the controlled environment. it is not as simple that increased concentration of co2 by xxx equals increase in temperature by yyy in real conditions. how do research papers take this into consideration? 

besides co2 increase...there are effects such as deforestation, increased urbanized area... how do we know what kind of effects do they have... lets assume that earth's global temperature has increased by x degrees over last 20 years.. 
how are the models able to separate each factor contribution? why most of the attention in the media is focused solely on co2?

""bri, you say: “the one problem for you, of course, is that recorded temperatures are more akin to what climatologists have said, not the downplayers and deniers.”

are they really, bri? for starters what most people don’t understand is that climate science doesn’t use raw temperatures, but anomalies. in simple terms this means a departure against a reference value or long-term average. this in itself leads to all sorts of issues from a statistical perspective. it also means that the actual temperature “increase” is miniscule.

another problem is that there’s no such thing as a “global temperature”. what climate ‘scientists’ use is a construct, which grossly oversimplifies climate reality. climate ‘scientists’ claim that warming is consistent across the globe but this is far from the case. many regions have seen no warming at all.

another problem is the dataset used. different datasets give different results. data is supposedly “corrected” to take account of all manner of things from changes in meteorological sites to the areas covered by sites in remote regions, some of which are vast.

i could go on listing problems — there are a huge number. the fact is that for every graph you show me claiming the models are “accurate” i could show you one claiming they’re not; and, no, these are not from bloggers but from scientists, including climate scientists.

however, one of the biggest issues — and this brings us back to the fundamental problem that i’ve explained over computer models predicting the future — is the accuracy and errors involved with the models and actual temperature records themselves. results shown by models are often smaller than the errors involved in the original measurements. that isn’t science. it’s nonsense.

a massive issue here is that when it comes to publishing papers, academic journals don’t want to publish papers that reveal “nothing happening here”, despite the fact that “nothing happening” is every bit as important.

as with everything to do with climate ‘science’, problems and issues are swept under the carpet. the simple fact is that climate is incredibly complex and very messy. none of that would matter if all climate scientists admitted this, but they don’t. people want plain and simple answers, which in reality don’t exist.""

but for the production of state and country wide energy we need nuclear fission its sitting at 5% of the world's energy at the moment but even that has saved thousands of people from the potion that is pollution and kept that area from the large effects of the oil and coal industry. nuclear fission can be described only as our savior, it produces more energy that fusion and no nuclear waste, i know not when this change comes but with how the world looks we will most likely rely on geoengineering to keep us safe from greenhouse gasses.
as for transportation electric cars should be stopped seeing as a battery will do more polluting than a lifetime of diesel. if we can find a way to make exhaust methane we could improve a tiny bit as methane breaks down far faster than co2. 
as for pollution such as the huge epidemic of plastic and paper bags i have only a few words , paper bags make for more tree harvesting weather it be logging or farming trees that were meant to be cut and for plastic bags/products algae plastics witch can break down in a matter of years.
another bit on pollution is landfill whilst methane is 'better' than co2 landfill produces far to much and landfill itself is just to much. there is to much trash that will take to long to decompose so even if we implement the clean plastics our number will only stay the same and never go down... but its a start.",0.9423

*the  ideas, solution and information in this article belong to me the savior  messiah buddha, any beings/entities/groups are required my special  permission in order to using it.*  


there are various ways to end the virus pandemic, the question now is what is the best way.  
if life is a game then you must connect all the major information got “propaganda/promoted” in the mainstream media.  


we will have a short lists:  
\- climate change – related to co2.  
\- global virus pandemic – lack of o2, dead, suffering.  
\- international trade war – financial system.  
\- migration crisis – lack of jobs, unfair wage/money rate.  


the  seal way, the best solution to end to global corona virus pandemic is  blaming the scientist for their wrong “assumption/understanding” about  climate change and co2.  
the most well-known symptom of people “got”  covid is lack of oxygen o2. or in other word you can say they have too  much co2 inside their body because o2 and co2 are opposite.  


then you can blame the scientist and say because people understand wrong about the climate change co2.  
you cannot restrict co2 for that how to god life system work and operation.  
if you are trying to “take” something then, it will be “transfer” to others.  
because all nations are cutting/reduce their co2 emission thus that created the corona virus covid.  


the  scientist do not even know how a small body work and operation, let’s  alone a much bigger subject the planet earth and the universe !  
so  people should not obsess with technology and science, they must connect  more with nature and use their brain to wonder about life instead of  rely on science.  


from then you can have a new standard of  foods/goods products which will require companies label the percentage  of o2 and or co2 within.  


and after that you can have an  additional financial system to “recover” post crazy pandemic and solve  the trade war, migration crisis !  


i do believe that is the scripture from the “referee”, you guys can ask and try that “pass code”.

0,"any insight is welcome! hello, 

i am currently enrolled in environmental courses (1) human impacts the environment (2) cultural/political ecology, and i’ve been thinking about a certain issue 

we’ve recently been talking about the relationship between the periphery and the core. to keep it short, how will developing countries combat climate change? it seems they are in a position where over exploitation of resources is necessary to support their economy due to the demand from developed countries for cheap raw resources. for instance, countries that have high rates of deforestation. to finalize my question, how will developing countries contribute to helping with the climate crisis when they are currently in this unequal relationship? 

i understand this is a complex topic. i’d love any articles you’ll can recommend, or any insight in general. also, correct me if i have information wrong. i’m just genuinely interested in this problem.",0.5426
0,"sustainability research survey hello fellow redditors,

i’m doing a research regarding sustainable clothing and i was wondering if you could help me by filling in this survey. it contains some basic questions about clothing recycling and other sustainable practices. it will take around 15 minutes of your day. maybe it will even inspire you with new ideas on how to become more sustainable.

you have to fill in a student number and a class number on the second page. these are: 0970747 and 203.

you can find the survey under the following link: http://evasys.hro.nl/evasys/online.php?p=x7vnc

the survey is meant for people from the netherlands, so you might not be able to answer a question or 2. please fill in neutral if this is the case. 

if you have any questions please let me know!

thank you very much in advance!",0.9285

0,"climate change impacts in agriculture in the netherlands  so i’m currently doing my thesis on the impacts of climatic trends in agriculture in the netherlands, especially droughts. though it would be nice to share some information on this subject to help climate impact feel more tangible.

since 2018 the netherlands has experienced above climatic average drought conditions during the summer months. these droughts have increasingly challenged agricultural crop production. in 2018, maize yields on sandy soils saw a reduction in the 70% range as it proved to be very poorly resistant to extreme drought. while reductions in potato crops ranged up to 20% to 25% for unirrigated plots. in total, the damages as a result of the 2018 drought was estimated at between 375 million to 1.9 billion euros.

first of all to clear the air, let me say that yes, due to the increased co2 fertilization effect we can expect plants to be more water efficient during the photosynthesis process. however, this is a mechanism often taken out of context by climate pseudo-sceptics. the mechanism holds well for processes at the leaf level which are often studied using controlled laboratory experiments, but one should caution when upscaling this relation from the leaf level to ecosystem level such as a crop architecture where the multiple confounding effects of the real world come into play. 

you see, it’s really nice that plants start to become more water efficient under higher co2 concentrations, but that holds no value anymore once the soil is completely rid of any soil water the plant can access at all. at that point, which we call the wilting point, the photosynthesis process can no longer take place, as the plant no longer has access to water which, by splitting into o2 and the h+ proton under sunlight, provides the critically needed energy for the photosynthetic process. also, plants cool down by transpiring water from their leaves, just as we humans do as we sweat. once water becomes limited, plants can no longer shed their heat and start to get sunburned or photosynthesis is reduced due to the enzymes disliking to operate at such temperatures. what also should be noted is that an increase in water use efficiency only covers transpiration from the plant leaves, and thus does not include the expected increase in evaporation of water directly from the soil projected to come with climate change which in turn influences the total available soil moisture a plant can use to transpire.

we think that we are increasingly starting to see that here in the netherlands an increase in water use efficiency (wue) only delays the occurrence of droughts in agriculture. in the end, the higher efficiency does not outweigh the increases in evapotranspiration and temperature in the long run. it’s a bit like driving the same distance with a more fuel-efficient car as you did with your older car, but with not enough gas to make it to your destination. crops can benefit from from the increased wue for a period of time in the growing season, but in the end it loses the battle anyway when there's very little or no water available at all anymore in the high summer months, which are often critical periods for plants in which they normally put energy in developing the botanical parts we humans are interested in (e.g. the potatoes tubers / maize cobs). on top of that, potatoes start to grow very poorly at temperatures above 25 degrees celcius, temperatures which are easily being surpassed by well over 10 degrees celcius in recent years, up to a record 40.9 degrees celcius in the summer of 2019 and more and more days on which get close to such temperatures. 

recently i’ve went through some papers which indicated that due to higher temperatures in the spring, as we’ve seen in the past few years, summer droughts in agriculture are exacerbated. this is due to natural vegetation starting to grow earlier and thus transpiring soil water earlier in the year. under a lack of precipitation, this reduces the water crops can take up from the soil. 

despite our drought problems, precipitation has actually increased by 26% in the netherlands in the past 100 years. the problem is that these increases are primarily featured during the winter months. precipitation events in the summer have become concentrated in more intense showers with more water falling from the sky per unit of time. these intense precipitation events tighten the ground very quickly causing overland flow of water so that precipitation is quickly discharged into streams which discharges the water away from the farming systems quickly, and the water does not infiltrate into the soil instead. this immediately lays bare an important issue in the design of the farming landscape in the netherlands; we have designed our agricultural landscape to be able to be discharged easily in case excessive amounts of water which we are known for to have been battling for hundreds of years. now these systems designed to easily transport water away, which we often still need during the winter, cause water to be transported away too quickly in the summer months when it’s needed on the fields. so, by fixing one problem mostly occurring during winter, we exacerbate another one during the summer.

another important boundary conditions from which the water in the soil develops is the groundwater table. i’ve looked up the data on the groundwater monitoring wells in the area i’m from (which features almost exclusively sandy soils) and since 2015 the average groundwater table has decreased by up to 60 cm on average. let’s say from about 80 cm for a plot i’m studying, to about 140 cm, and the trend is continuing downward up to this date. sure the groundwater gets filled up in the winter to about the same amount every year, but the replenishment has increasingly been outweighed by the increased evapotranspiration in the summer. 

now i’ve talked to farmers in the area which are suffering from these droughts (when i was young i’ve always had side jobs in agriculture myself). they have to spend much more time, energy and money to maintain their crops, and still these efforts do not guarantee an acceptable crop yield. of course, this is impacting their finances, and there’s been increasing discussion on the feasibility of current agricultural practices in the netherlands.

note that this post focusses on droughts in relation to agriculture. for natural ecosystems, however, the droughts have had similar negative impacts. streams run dry from which fish have to be rescued, animals are suffering from heat stress, there’s been an increase in forest fires and peat gets oxidized causing problematic land subsidence. this is occurring in already problematic times for the natural environment suffering from excessive nitrogen usage by farmers and subsequent biodiversity loss.

we are seeing some other severely negative impacts of climate change in the netherlands. theses include land subsidence, salt water intrusion, adverse psychological affects of heat and damage to infrastructure, but i would like to come back to these topics later in different posts.",0.9584

0,"hello all! i wanted to ask for the opinion of this group regarding a series of questions/statements for a school assignment. i look forward to responses/opinions and discussion in the comments :)  

* if earth has been warmer in the past, what is the issue now?

the earth has been in and out of icehouse/greenhouse periods throughout its time. typically, after an ice age has ended it can take the planet about 5,000 years to warm between 4 and 7 degrees celsius. this is a very slow increase, which is part of why our current situation is concerning. we exited the last glacial period 20,000 years ago, and have since been in a warm interglacial period. during the last century, there has been a warming of a little over 1 degree fahrenheit. this is 8 times faster than the average ice-age recovery time, and the last 5 years have been the warmest years in centuries.

* what are the causes for the temperature increasing?

a large cause of the temperature increase is the increased output of co2. greenhouse gases are necessary in order to keep our planet warm enough for life to exist, too much can cause the planet to become warmer than what we can withstand.

* how do we know that this is from human impact?

we know that the temperature increase is from human impact because we have been able to pin the start of temperature changes starting at the industrial revolution. volcanoes and el nino have been looked at and considered as potential contributors, but their effects do not carry long-term changes to the planet to account for the rapid warming.

* how do we know that the earth has been warmer/colder in the past?

scientists have been able to determine what the climate was like in the past by studying ice cores from deep below the surface in antarctica and sediment cores from the bottom of lakes or oceans. these cores can give information as to what the earth's climate was like hundreds to millions of years ago. they tell us about the amount of co2 in the air, and if events such as large volcanic eruptions occurred.

* what is the problem with the temperature increasing?

climate changes (even natural ones) are disruptive to the planet. climate changes in the past have led to mass extinctions of species, changed the circulation of the ocean, and changed how animals migrate. this impacts us today because humans and animals cannot adapt quickly enough to this rapid increase in temperature.

* what about texas? one of the warmest states just froze over. how can that mean warming?

texas had its sudden blast of cold air due to warming temperatures. the air that is above the arctic had warmed suddenly, which resulted in a weakening of the polar vortex. this caused the cold air to come down, and cause texas to basically freeze over. other weather changes can occur, such as more frequent and intense hurricanes due to warmer waters and an increase in wildfires due to droughts.

what do you think?

do you think that we are causing an impact on the warming of the planet? if not, why do you think that? if you agree, what do you think we can do to help try to reverse the warming of our planet?",0.992

0,"are you lowering your co2 emissions? here are a few apps to make it much easier. at this moment i have achieved carbon negativity and i wanted to share the apps i’ve been using with you, so you can increase your efforts with less effort.

**treeapp** - i’ve been planting a tree a day for free using this app, all i have to do is view an ad about a partnered eco-friendly brand. it’s a win-win.

**plantfortheplanet** - i’ve been planting trees in small bulks using this un-backed app, with costs as low as 20p per tree it’s a great booster. 

**ecosia** - i’ve been planting trees whilst i search the internet with this search engine, it’s about 45 searches to plant 1 tree and that’s barely anything.

**yayzy** - i’ve been tracking my bank spending and paying to offset their co2 contributions with this app, it’s simple to use and it’s cheap to offset emissions. 

these apps have saved me a bunch of time whilst enabling me to do my part, if you’re on this mission then give them a look (if you don’t use them already).

get that people, you’re living in a financial system based upon growth ever expanding growth with an ever growing population, the shit kickers like bill gates who’ve already made their money from inventions that increased global emissions will tell the masses or time we stopped haha of course his remit is self protection for his wealth not the planet, just like noam chomsky said why have mass riches if the society you live in is on its knees.

anyone who says you can produce enough energy through renewables to keep up with growth is a liar, it simply cannot be done unless science has a miracle, and anyone who has the knowledge knows what the miracle is.

until then your best bets are nuclear, coal, and oil.

0,"scientific approach to climate change vs covid why hasn't climate change science evolved and challenged assumptions in the same way that science did during the covid pandemic?

one of the hall marks of any well done science is challenging assumptions in the science and updating scientific forecasting as assumptions change. it's very clear that this was the way science was done during the covid pandemic  - there were constant changes in guidance as understanding of the virus and pandemic evolved.

yet whenever i read in the media about climate change there seems to be no change in guidance on climate change based on an evolving understanding and challenging assumptions - it seems to be the same constant refrain.

the following quote from richard feynman seems to apply to the way science was done when applied to the covid pandemic, but i don't see evidence of it in the media when applied to global warming:

&#x200b;

> i would like to add something that's not essential to the science, but something i kind of believe, which is that you should not fool the laymen when you're talking as a scientist. . . . i'm talking about a specific, extra type of integrity that is not lying, but bending over backwards to show how you're maybe wrong, \[an integrity\] that you ought to have when acting as a scientist. and this is our responsibility as scientists, certainly to other scientists, and i think to laymen.",0.9389

now. the ill effect is mainly greenhouse gasses and carbon emissions. these are caused by corporations mostly, who lobby the government for regulations in their favour. the pandemic has been a huge show of cards in how fast emissions cut down when corporations slow production. so it can be done. the government is supposed to be a force that controls what a corporation can and can't do, and the government is (supposed to be) controlled by the people. the fact that they (government) allow corporations to continue their huge emissions but punish the people is wrong and corrupt (for example, making it illegal or requiring people to get permits to farm their land, including livestock) - i'm fairly certain the people don't agree with having their rights stripped from them so a corporation can do what they want. 


there is a program called the high-frequency active auroral research program. this is a weather manipulation and control program for changing weather. i'm not going to go into how it works, just that it uses microwave frequencies directed at the sky to affect the weather, and ""chemtrails"" are a part of this program to add conductivity (chemtrails contain aluminum, barium, and strontium among others) for the frequencies.

so. the negative effect problem is emissions, the solution is to slow production and change energy sources, and move to renewable energy sources - by the way, human labour is a renewable resource most people overlook. many tasks are automated now, which used to be human labour. we could go back to that. it would solve a lot of the unemployment problem. or for example, if you look a the united states penitentiary, which in 2020 had 1.8 million prisoners, and assume a minimum of 100 watts per prisoner, you would be able to produce 1800 kw, for how many hours they work. obviously, equipment would be an issue, but that can be solved by one generator powered by multiple bikes or whatever machine.
it could also solve an obesity problem in america, along with an unemployment issue... but i digress, that's a different issue from what i'm trying to put forth.

back to the regularly scheduled programming...

the solution can include use of haarp to push rain and sun exposure to places that need it more or less. but right now it may be doing more harm than good. aluminium is a heavy metal, which is being absorbed by plants, and ingested by humans. it's harming the soil, and the earth.",-0.9847

here are my points. 

1. have most jobs and school remotely if the student or employee has access to internet and a computer
this would reduce emissions by a lot just like march 2020, the beginning of covid quarantine. there would be less traffic and emissions. 

2. have population control. as an anti-natalist i think is the most effective solution, why would you ask. because if there is less people there will be less pollution and less consumption of fossil fuels. my proof to this is the last century there was rarely any green energy or renewables used but there is less emissions than today. today despite have green energy or renewables our emissions are much higher than the 1990s. (i am sorry this reason is controversial but it's truth)

3. install carbon capture in every factory or building that emits greenhouse gases. this new technology carbon capture is something to be thankful about since it does the work on 30 million trees. if we could install this on every factory or corporations building that emits greenhouse gases it can suck the gases and turn it into diamonds or other cool things instead of polluting our air and warming the planet.

it would have solar panels that would power it during the day and if it didn't have access to the sun it would use the remaining energy and if absolutely needed would use 4 small hydraulic turbines to power it during the night completely powered by ai and if broken would use an anchor to stay in the place until it could fixed or replaced

0,"life in a warmer world: a short story the date: thursday january 14, 2050. the place: teaneck, new jersey

jason stanlish's alarm sounded at 6 am and the electroluminescent ceiling panels flooded his bedroom with a warm light. after brushing his teeth and shaving, he mosied into his closet. checking the electronic wall, he saw the temperature outside was 47 degrees, so he only needed a light jacket. he went downstairs to find his wife, sophia, and 2 children, noah and lisa, in the kitchen eating breakfast.  sophia packed the kids lunch which was the usual:  lab grown lobster sandwiches, fresh nectarines, now available even in winter, and gatorade. sophia said that they needed to call the landscaper again, as they had more weeds in the yard. jason grumbled that when he was a kid, the frost would keep the weeds in check. sophia responded that when he was a kid, driveways would need to be repaved, pipes would burst, and ice dams would form on the roof. jason replied ""touche"".

he and his wife kissed each other goodbye and drove off to work. jason slid behind the wheel, set the gps for work, and backed out. his car could drive itself like all the others, but he enjoyed doing things himself. 2 minutes later, he was accelerating up to 85 mph on interstate 80. at this moment, he was at peace. his car's electric motors, there were 4 of them, one in each wheel, made a silent hum, his tires, which just a few decades ago were advertised as ""summer tires"", made barely a rumble. traffic these days was so quiet that the njdot had removed the old ugly sound barriers and replaced them with palm trees. he turned on the radio. in the news: two ships had collided off the coast of siberia on the arctic route, the nigerian government was formulating a plan to relocate the people displaced as lake chad expanded, and a new report showed that due to the year round growing season, pollen production had risen 50%. the ride was smooth, owing to both his car's active suspension and the lack of freeze thaw cycles that used to leave nasty potholes that would need to be repaired and snarl up traffic. and the overpasses looked good now that there was no need for road salt which used to corrode bridges, cars, and pollute water supplies. highway maintenance costs had fallen so much that the state was able to remove tolls on the garden state parkway and the new jersey turnpike. and without road salt or dirty snow, jason almost never needed to go to the carwash, although with more birds out, the guano was an issue.

soon he was pulling into the parking garage of the place he worked, the deerfield-simmons engineering company located in parsippany-troy hills. the company had thrived as a result of climate change and the explosion in materials science in the 20s and 30s that had created the opportunity for many spectacular megaprojects. they had overseen the construction of the dams that protected greenland's glaciers from warm water calving, the resulting warming of the arctic ocean led to the collapse of the thermocline that kept the warm, salty atlantic water from flowing at the surface, thereby making the arctic ice free year round and basically eliminating snow from the northern hemisphere. they also built similar dams in antarctica to prevent the ice from melting. it was so effective that the ice sheet began to expand, and the possibility of damage to the dams from the expanding ice was one of the things jason was working on.

jason loved his job, he was living through a golden age of civil engineering. he got to build the dome over metlife stadium, as it was no longer needed to accommodate snow, making the project cost effective. he helped design solar power satellites that provided the world with limitless cheap, clean energy. he spoke to the vancouver office where they were putting roads on stilts in northern canada so they could survive the melting of the permafrost. he spoke to the los angeles office, which was tasked with removing the la river's concrete lining as laser cloud seeding had eliminated the violent downpours that made it necessary. at lunch, he walked over the pedestrian bridge to the shake shack across the street. he spoke to a friend who worked for noaa, who confirmed that the reduction in the northern hemisphere's temperature gradient had indeed caused the great tornado drought. jason quipped ""good news for dorothy and toto"".

at 5:00, jason congratulated himself for finishing another 32 hour work week and went home for the weekend. the next day, the family drove down to atlantic city. it was 58 degrees and the place was packed. the children enjoyed the boardwalk amusement park rides. and jason and sophia met an older couple from delaware, who had travelled to jersey on the biden bridge, spanning from lewes to cape may. they said ""it's funny. when we were young, we'd go to florida for the warmth, now it seems florida has come to us."". sophia said ""i can drink to that"".",0.9951

i'm currently doing some research for a university design project.

i'm looking at creating a vision for communities of the future (or today) that incorporates **everything** required to solve the climate emergency problem.

there are examples of communities that have gone ""100% renewable energy"" or ""net-zero carbon"" and while this is great, there is often a downfall somewhere that negates the gains made by whatever the label given was. an example being sinclair meadows in the uk, the first street to be 'carbon negative' in the uk. this is fantastic, however, it only considers energy use of the homes and materials used in the construction of the houses. the residents could all be eating heavy red-meat diets or not shopping locally and totally wipe out any gains made elsewhere.

the vision i'm looking to create is something where absolutely every consideration, from the physical materials, services, lifestyles, diet, education etc is all pulling in the same direction, and therefore becomes truly 'sustainable' and zero-impact.

i would love your input into this system idea, absolutely anything you can offer positive or negative is welcome and appreciated.

some prompts for you to think about could be:

* perceived relative advantage – over existing systems
* ease of use – of any tangible elements including ergonomic and anthropometric detail of physical and psychological fit
* perceived compatibility – with existing products, services and systems
* perceived value – whether the potential value of a new system is readily seen
* cultural acceptance – whether the system is acceptable to potential users and personnel involved in its delivery

2. the least productive land in the world  in terms of food production and live support is the one used for roads, cover the roads with solar pannels for energy production instead of using productive land for this purpose.
3. reintroduce large mammals to semi dessertic lands, they will create a symbiotic live cicle that will make plants thrive again.
4. plant fruit trees everywhere, they are huge supporters of life in general, most animals can feed from them and their manure fertilizes the land.
5. implement a life tax: one person can eat 100 baby shrimps in one meal, the same person could be full with just 5 jumbo shrimps. by implementing the life tax (for example a tax of 3 cents per animals 1 pound or less, 1 dollar per animals 1 pound to 5 pounds, 5 dollars per animals 5 pounds to 25  etc) we would make smaller animals more expensive, forcing people to consume larger animals and at the same time collect money to be spent exclusively to protect biodiversity.

2-after that we can use another method to separate the molecules of the carbon dioxide and turns it in pure carbon.

3-now we have to return it to the nature and here's where my imagination kicks in(more than before). we could freeze the co2 in a bar shape, about 20 cm in lenght and we could put these bars, in controlled quantities in the middle of the forests, like the amazon rainforest, the congo forests, the forests in russia, etc. where the carbon can be successfully storaged, in the trees :d",0.9477

0,"climate alarmists' delusions of grandeur i own a copy of the 1972 sci-fi novel *the sheep look up* by john brunner. it's set in the near future  where pollution has made the world almost uninhabitable, people in urban areas need to wear gas masks when they go outdoors, don't drink notices are issued due to water pollution, acid rain forces people to wear plastic to protect their clothes, the oceans are lifeless and smelly, and leaks from dumped barrels of nerve gas are getting into groundwater and causing people to go insane. 

brunner's dark prediction of the future was rooted in the environmental crisis that the world realized it was in in the late 60s and early 70s. my mom was a child living in buffalo at that time and can recall the signs put up telling people not to swim in lake erie, which had made ""eutrophication"" a household term. in 1966 over thanksgiving, an inversion layer formed over new york city, causing a smog disaster that killed 168 people and would've killed a lot more if it happened on a normal work day where there were more cars, trucks, and buses on the streets and factories weren't idled. 

and while such castrophes aren't as common today, they still occur. the salton sea in california is drying up and threatens to pelt southern california with arsenic rich dust.

despite all of this, the alarmists claim that the rise of earth's temperature by a few degrees is a bigger disaster than poisoning the great lakes with raw sewage or people dropping dead in the streets from smog.",-0.9834

most of the plant life in my front and back yard are wilting! they were not built for this type of environment and by the time the snow all melts, my house will be surrounded by dead plants simply because of a snowstorm that would be normal in ohio, but not in texas. just when i thought the snow would finally melt yesterday, so many snowflakes are falling as i write this.

so here's my two ideas might be a bit strange but idk just a thought.

1. create large nuclear powered drills that dig deep into safe parts of the earth where there will be the smallest danger/risk of catastrophic volcanic activity. we can use this to decrease the sea level as the water moves in to fill the holes. around these areas we can put chemoautotrophic bacteria to take care of the hydrogen sulphide.

2. i once saw that someone invented a type of foam that can harden over water and float. capable of remaining buoyant and supportive of structures on top. i don’t remember what it was called. however we could place large platforms of this material in the ocean, and then place very reflective mirrors or liquid mirrors on top to reflect light. we can add this to the tops of buildings and skyscrapers across the world as well to reflect some light.",0.9762

source: saviorjoy.livejournal.com; freejoy.aimoo.com

the  two most popular signal of climate change is sea level raising  and  much more co2 emission release on the air. you cannot avoid it, you   must deal with it.  
you must “capture/using” water and co2 as much as possible at the fastest speed as possible.

the  only one human activity can do both things is planting trees,  because  trees is the only one thing can capture both co2 and water at  the same  time.

in order to raise public  awareness and have a reason for all kind of  military weapon can be  used, you must making plant trees as a real  competitive sport. and in  this sport you can have a lot of different  categories but the first one  must be planting as many trees as possible  in any location on earth.

by doing that, you can allow other countries go into very hash weather location such as dessert to planting trees legally.  
if  you look at the planet earth map, the best places to plant trees are   australia and the africa, since they are have a lot of sunshine but   lack of water from rivers/lakes.  
but in order to use all kind of   military tools to create rivers which connect direct to the ocean, you   must have a public legal reason.

the  contest could be all team/nations have a same desert area like  10000  square km2, within 1 year which team can have the most  quantity/quality  of tree who capture the most amount of co2 + water will  become the  winner and receive a lot of prize wealth.

of  course you need to pay the citizens in those planting tree nations   (australia, africa) a fair amount of money from $1000 to $5000 per year   depend on their location/gdp.

to  summary, the best and fastest solution to solve the global climate   change problems is planting as many tree as possible and in order to do   that with public agreement you must make it like a competitive sport.

the  formula to planting tree is creating as many rivers/lakes as  possible  first (you should use bomb), then drop the seeds/leafs from  above  (aircraft). water + sunshine = trees.

over  the last 50 years, the population is increase at rapid speed,  but the  trees/forest area is not, and that is one of main reason you  have what  so called climate change global warming.

i  do believe that my solution/strategy is the best one to save this   civilization from the natural catastrophe and climate change/global   warming problem, so you can send the reward/donation to my   cryptocurrency wallets below:

my name is ian. i am currently taking a class called design thinking for social product innovation at the university i am attending. the overall goal of the class is to identify a problem within a country and come up with a product that would help to solve the problem. i decided to focus on how climate change is affecting bangladesh. i read about how much of bangladesh is exposed to flooding due to sea levels rising and thought focusing on communities facing these hardships would be a good idea for my project. 

i am currently in the process of coming up with ideas for products that could help to solve the problem. however, i am in need of panel members that would be interested in helping me out. i have never been to bangladesh so having panel members from the country allows me to better understand what life is like there. also, having panel members that are experienced in the topic of climate change is very useful too. if you are interested in my project and would like to be a panel member, which mainly consists of remaining in contact with me in case i need some information or to share ideas, let me know. i greatly appreciate any help i can get. if you need to contact me, you can leave a comment or message me. thank you for your time.",0.9834

source: saviorjoy.livejournal.com; freejoy.aimoo.com

i  just see a big bounty reward on the public for global carbon  capture,  so it means there are much more wealth bounty in secret   societies/groups, from few hundreds millions to billions us dollar.

so today i will not debate about whether co2 is right or wrong direction, i will only focus on the objective **“carbon capture”**.

the best technology is human brain !  
there won’t be any technology can beat that fact.  
but  if you are talking about the technology machine which seen in the   public then i will talk to you that the current technology is enough to   combat the global warming co2 capture, the problem is you guys do not   yet know how to utilize to bring the highest potential out of the   current technology.

now let’s analyze about the goal “co2 carbon capture”.  
there is no any device can calculate the whole planet co2 emission, that is the fact.  
but you cannot use the number in small lab house.  
not only that, the number of co2 is increase every years.  
it takes a lot of time to produce any machine/devices, just an example are some aircraft, rocket.  
and it takes a lot of natural resources to do so, and it takes a lot of people.

so the best solution must be **“plant as many trees as possible in a short period of time”**.  
because it is easy to implement, and everybody can do it.  
it is not about the quality of a machine, it is about the “quantity”.  
it  is about how much co2 carbon you can “absorb/capture” compare the  the  co2 carbon release to the public environment as a whole overtime.

so  the objective “carbon capture” can be understood as “the quantity x   quality of trees to  be produced/planted in a short period of time”.

when it come down to planting trees, there are a lot of solutions very easy to implement but with a lot of effective:  
**- at public normal people level:**  
\+  tell the public that you can reduce the virus spread/damage by   planting more trees in your house/garden/yard/county/city, etc.  
\+ put free money bounty for every household who have meet certain amount of tree in a month or so.

**- at top military government:**  
\+ use airplanes/aircraft to spread the “seeds” from the sky like using that to pour water over the wild fire.  
about  the “seeds” here, since every soil have their own feature and you  do  not know which one fit with which seeds/trees, so the best way to   blending the “seeds” and “leafs” (with water) of everything together   then spreading it out from above. i can guarantee this method will works   because the seeds/trees will “automatic” connect with each others to   grow.

that is the best solution to capture the co2 emission for the whole planet.  
there is no any other better way than that.

i  am confident my strategy/method is working and is the winning   solution, so i will put my cryptocurrency wallet here, so you guys can   send donations to any wallets:

that is only about “carbon capture”.  
if  you want to fully  understand how the planet earth operation, then all  you need is compare  it with human body, it has a lot of common  features.  
you are not  going not wear face mask or reduce your co2  releasing level when playing  sports for it like going to commit  suicide.  
so the goal “capture co2” is a much better approach than reducing the co2 emission.

i'm looking for the most accurate and complete account of what is causing the increase of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. i would also like to know what the best source is for finding climate information. i'm looking for peer-reviewed scientific papers, as i can deal with working through the terminology and mathematics.   


i would like studies which take into account things like the effect of different industries, and the industrial processes that cause the emissions, what type of emissions are produced, how effective each molecule type (e.g. co2, ch4, n2) is at being a greenhouse gas, and the quantity of each of these different greenhouse gases released by those processes.

why aren't we talking about rigging coastal cities up with levees and drainage pumps?  switching to warm-weather crops to prevent food shortages?  investing in desalination?  millions of people will need to move inland and to colder areas: why aren't we talking about how we'll facilitate mass relocations and build enough housing for them?

i was wondering what you think are the best places that will struggle least with the effects of climate change.   
of course, everywhere on earth will be affected, but some areas (like around the equator) obviously much more.

personally, i have been thinking (in europe) about either scandinavia (as in = norway, sweden, iceland, finland)  or switzerland. outside europe, new zealand and canada seem fine as well.  


some of my reasoning:

scandinavia = they might benefit from a warming earth as more land might be available to be farmed.  
switzerland = they might deal with a warming earth as more of the mountains might become habitable or usable, that aren't currently, + there is still a large amount of freshwater there in ice. + the country is rich enough to deal with a lot of the negative impacts (and is concerned about the topic). also, in case of conflict, switzerland is not likely to be a target, as every male that went to the army there (which is mandatory) has a weapon + they also care a lot about possible defence and are rather isolationist.

i know that co2 levels are highest than they have been in 400,000 years( unsure about the metric exactly), as a result of humans burning things all the time. i know that global temperatures have risen since the industrial revolution.
. i always agreed with everyone around me and the ideas we were taught, until i realized that some things didn’t make sense and some things were just wrong(according to some people).

i was initially taught in elementary school that the green house gasses tear holes in the ozone layer, causing more of the suns heat energy to be absorbed by the globe. later, in middle school i was taught that the ozone layer healed itself and that the whole concept was false.
this prompted me to do even more research on my own and i still don’t know who to believe, what is right and what is wrong. 

i’ve seen plenty of graphs about the atmospheric carbon and the global temperatures, and here’s what i know for certain:
1. atmospheric carbon is at an all time high as a result of fossil fuel and natural gas burning(among other things like industrial farming and deforestation)
2. the global temperatures have fluctuated constantly as a result of many factors including the earths changing axis and ecological impacts on carbon consumption/production. 

and here is something i’m unsure about the validity of:
carbon in the atmosphere, along with other greenhouse gasses, as the name suggests, traps heat energy within the atmosphere causing more heat to stay on and around earth longer instead of transferring the energy to space.

the two graphs don’t make sense to me as the earth has been around for much longer than 500 years, and because my psychology class taught that correlation ≠ causation. 

what doesn’t make sense to me is how climate scientists have been able to make the conclusion that atmospheric carbon causes the specific heat increase we are seeing now, without considering greater factors that could be at play. 

is there any sources that can confirm this concept? can anyone fill any gaps in my knowledge?

p.s. i am not denying climate change. i am skeptical about the idea that carbon emissions are a direct cause of the climate change we are seeing now. i support renewable energy, and i think everyone should. i just want to be as informed as possible about this subject as to aid me in my future decision making. any help is appreciated, sorry for the long ass post, thank you!",0.9863

while i agree with this, the writer's example was reusing something like a metal straw vs disposable. 

when people think that this change is ""difficult"" and therefore do not discuss other changes further, nothing will change. there's so much marketing put into reusing or recycling and so little into actual solutions that produce far greater results. results that it seems like you could go vegan and not recycle and still do more. there might be other examples but i can only think of veganism as i do not know much about this. 

reducing or removing meat/dairy from your diet likely does much more. 

i agree with small steps but if you only have $10k for a $50k surgery, you're still not getting surgery. so maybe we shouldn't say small steps are great, we should try to find better more efficient ways (they might even be easier, difficult doesn't mean good). 

it's also frustrating as this article seemed to be very high horse about this one small change and act as if other people's changes are equal and worse, send the message that this type of change is (1) super useful (2) enough. maybe a reusable straw is harder than being vegan for some, but i doubt that is the norm.",0.9659
0,"how does deep ocean carbonate chemistry work?  

hey there, i am trying to understand the chemistry of oceans, primarily deep ocean carbon/acidification

i understand surface ocean chemistry just fine (atmospheric co2=ocean level in equilibrium, no increase in acidification/co3 concentration/co2 derived ph drop with stable atmospheric co2 concentration, etc) but deep ocean i cannot understand

\-what controls very deep ocean ph/buffering? considering the very bottom of the ocean does not receive any caco3, is under the calcite horizon line, etc what prevents runaway acidification at the bottom of the ocean over thousands of years after the surface ocean mixes considering it takes millennia for co2 to bury as sediment after it reaches the deep ocean?

\-why are there predictions on many sites of the calcite horizon shallowing to only 1000m around 2100 when even 50 million years ago when co2 was past 4000ppm, the calcite horizon has consistently been 4km +/- 0.6km from then until now?

\-assuming humans can scale direct air carbon capture on a mass scale and we return atmospheric co2 to 300-350ppm, would the deep oceans co2 vent to the atmosphere the same as the surface ocean would to keep in equilibrium? or is deep ocean co2 basically just stuck there and down the line, surface ocean with less co2 saturation will mix in?

\-is the calcite horizon directly reflective on atmospheric co2 concentrations? ie if we top out at 800ppm of co2 by 2080, but utilize carbon capture and reduce to 350ppm in 2100, would the calcite horizon naturally deepen?

i'm trying to understand the relationship between increased co2 concentrations in the air (i.e. climate change) and the ability of our ocean to dissolve this co2 in the water (leading to acidification)

my confusion is related to the seeming contradiction of the following facts...

(1) as oceans get warmer, they are able to absorb less co2, not more. (some warm waters are sources of co2) 

(2) increased atmospheric co2 is leading to warmer temperatures, and thus increased oceans temps. 

so.....wouldn't it be the case that as climate change is warming oceans, our oceans would absorb less co2 (not more), and thus acidification would be increasing at a decreasing rate? what am i getting wrong?",0.5842

the problem is that the closest one is about 9 miles away from my house -- and using the estimate of 605 g co2 / km for a gas-powered car, i generate about 17 kg of atmospheric co2 per round trip.  i don't have an electric vehicle, and i can't easily carpool or take public transport. 

an additional ethical question is the risk of possible covid exposure ... mask and glove-wearing are enforced, but it is difficult to stay 6 feet apart within the warehouse.  i can't come up with a thorough quantitative analysis, but suppose the risk of infection is 1% each time  -- volunteering a few days a week for a month would yield a 12% likelihood that i contract covid in a given month, and possibly spread it to others in my family, or to my one local friend with whom i don't social distance. while no one in either of our households is particularly at risk, with a death rate of 0.015%, this feels significant.

i hear a lot that there are worse and worse hurricanes, fires are more common, water levels are getting higher and extreme weather is a direct cause of our human influence on the world.


**but how related are these?**

i hear for instance from other scientist that yes the climate getting warmer and colder depending on the season is indeed found to be correlated to human influence, however we see little proof of it in terms of disasters.


**they say** hurricanes *do* cause more property damage **but** the amount and power of said hurricanes is decreasing over a long period of time, it's just that we have more expensive properties and more people in the path of said hurricanes than before.


**they say** that no the water levels are not getting higher as a direct cause of humans, if you look at charts over hundreds of years of land uplift and subsidence keeps on going in about the same pace as it has always done, which is different depending on which area you look at.

etc.


so i'll leave it off to you to help convince me on actual statistics over what is going on here.

why don't we regulate climate like we regulate everything? we've created dams, sucked water from aquifers, created cities, destroyed forests, changed landscapes, we've basically changed the world... so what would be stopping us from controlling our climate for the better and why isn't more research being done into it?

reducing carbon emissions is incredibly important, but i think we're way passed that, and reducing emissions alone won't stop climate change. additionally, the earth is in an interglacial period right now, coming out of an ice age and it's only going to get worse. why not start controlling our climate now before our ice caps fully melt? 

there are lots of cheap/safe particles we could spray like calcium carbonate. these particles could also dissolve in the ocean neutralizing ocean acidification right? i'm no chemist but it seems doable.

we'd also need more carbon sinks, so carbon scrubbing would be important too, and planting more trees. 

we could also utilise the albedo effect by painting our roofs white.

eventually, if we overcompensate for climate change, we could change it in the other direction by burning fossil fuels again. we'd effectively be able to regulate global climate.

what is your opinion on having children to help the battle against climate change?

i personally think its ridiculous. if you believe you a good human being who cares about the environment and has a good brain. your kids will probably hold those values and work towards a better future. you might give birth to the person who comes up with some incredible solution. 

i also think it's pretty dumb because the people who don't care are going to keep having kids regardless and those kids will probably pick up on their values. leaving us with a great percentage of people who are not going to try and fix climate change.

0,"this is evidence it may be too late human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases – are a primary driver of climate change – and present one of the world’s most pressing challenges.1 this link between global temperatures and greenhouse gas concentrations – especially co2 – has been true throughout earth’s history.2

to set the scene, let’s look at how the planet has warmed. in the chart we see the global average temperature relative to the average of the period between 1961 and 1990.

the red line represents the average annual temperature trend through time, with upper and lower confidence intervals shown in light grey.

we see that over the last few decades, global temperatures have risen sharply — to approximately 0.7℃ higher than our 1961-1990 baseline. when extended back to 1850, we see that temperatures then were a further 0.4℃ colder than they were in our baseline. overall, this would amount to an average temperature rise of 1.1℃.

because there are small year-to-year fluctuations in temperature, the specific temperature increase depends on what year we assume to be ‘pre-industrial’ and the end year we’re measuring from. but overall, this temperature rise is in the range of 1 to 1.2℃.3",0.5789

i feel so sick about it all. i am recently married, and there's all this family pressure (and pressure from my wife) to have kids and build a family as humans are supposed to do. but when i look at the world and climate news, i just see so much evidence of it becoming a nasty, nasty place in the future. i have been depressed about my own existence and how it's so sad that i can't go back to the naive childhood i had where the earth was an everlasting wonderland. i grew up playing in the woods, exploring streams and fields and finding all the little animals in there. i grew up in love with nature as many kids do. i grew up thinking that the biggest problems in the world were lack of food for poor kids in other countries and unknown wars in far away lands.

but none of those problems equate to what we're dealing with now, and it's incredibly sad to think how every human who lives today is only going to watch it get worse and worse until eventually, our cumulative sins against the environment from us and our ancestors will reach the point of no return and we'll enter a hellish spiral of climate refugees and natural disasters that would make hollywood take note.

what am i supposed to do with all this? if i have kids, what are they going to aspire too? how can they find comfort and a purpose for their lives if their father can't? what kind of toll is it going to take on their mental health? what will i say to them if it gets as bad as i fear it will, and they'll want to know why i created them?",-0.9979

0,"is there evidence for any of these doomsday claims? you know the ones... humans and all other mammals are going to go extinct (i’m talking short term, not long term) / the air will be unbreathable because of plankton die off and burning the amazon / we’re all going to starve / mass wars /no water / ocean acidification will cause oceans to be barren wastelands devoid of life / if there’s a blue ocean event/permafrost melts/some other feedback loop the world will become uninhabitable hot / etc etc

i’ve read a lot of the papers and while i see that things will be bad, particularly in some places more than others, but i don’t see anything to back up these more sensational claims. 

am i misinterpreting instability, more crop failures, decreased yields, and price hikes? i kinda figured not all of the crops would all fail at once everywhere. so like maybe this year rice is in short supply and way more expensive, maybe next year corn is in short supply and a particular region struggles but not everybody all over the world is starving to death or killing each other over food. also won’t some areas (russia, canada)  be able to make more food? what about all the food that goes to feeding livestock and making fuel? couldn’t that be diverted before say letting your entire population starve? maybe food is different and we can’t just go to the store and get everything we’re used to all the time, but i feel like the “there will be no food everyone will starve” is a bit exaggerated (not to downplay how big of a deal this is for developing nations where this is already a problem today, never mind climate change)

am i misinterpreting the heatwaves? as in we already get deadly heatwaves, even here in canada, and some people die from them every year (many more in hotter areas i realize yes). i kinda figured from reading the papers that we’d see more of them, more often, and they would last longer. but not as in it will be so hot it will kill everyone or they will need to migrate (i could potentially see some areas of the world having to migrate that are already very hot and/or very dry) but when they talk about deadly heatwaves is it not the same definition as them currently which are already common place (so just becoming more common/worse)

also what about water? aren’t some areas supposed to get more rain? i worry about this one a bit more as our local summers are getting drier and drier and forest fires are becoming a bigger risk here, but is it realistic to think that most places will face severe water shortages? outside of places that are already water insecure getting worse?

i don’t know. i went back and forth on this before getting pregnant and came the conclusion that yes climate change is going to be bad, but not making life not worth living bad. for example even with the claims of mammal die off, some animals that are local: deer, elk, bear, cougar, wolf, raccoon... at 50% pick 3... man even without elk, cougar or wolves for example i’d still say life is worth living as much as it would be an unimaginable tragedy to lose them. but not being able to feed my son or having enough water i don’t think i could bear (although it’s kinda too late now.) is that something i really, likely have to worry about in canada? is that something he will likely have to worry about in his lifetime? i don’t know if i’m just more sensitive to these sensationalized headlines but they seem to be everywhere, and so many people posting on social media and redit posts in the same line: that this is the end and yes it’s going to be that bad and (we’re mostly) all going to die or suffer so greatly that life wouldn’t be worth living anyways. am i missing something? where is the evidence that it’s going to be that bad?",-0.9992

0,"a positive mindset on climate change hello! i hope this sort of post is allowed on this sub. it’s long, so i apologize in advance. tl;dr on the bottom. 

climate change is a large problem, yes? it is indeed, and it’s one of my own largest worries- which in itself is a privilege, i suppose. not everyone gets the chance to worry about issues the size of the planet. many people have too many personal issues that (understandably) are prioritized. 

i’ve been trying to reshape my mindset about climate change. to explain it, take a look at the coronavirus. it’s been about a year since it first started popping up, and a vaccine is already almost finished. that’s *bonkers*. the entire world was focused on it all at once, and look what we’ve managed to accomplish! this in particular is what gives me a lot of hope: a top quality vaccine nearly finished in a matter of months is something incredible to people of decades ago (think about how long it took to make the polio vaccine, for example). think of how much tech we have invented in our lifetimes that people of the past couldn’t even imagine. 

why wouldn’t that apply to climate change, as well? soon, more and more people across the planet who are currently comfortable will begin to become uncomfortable. it’ll get their attention, as much as they don’t want to give it. already, most of the world at least knows what climate change is, which is already progress from 10 years ago. the environment is getting more attention than ever before. it’s becoming trendy to be green, which in itself is a lot of power. humanity will reach the point very soon (before 2030, i argue) where we have no choice but to stop kicking the can down the road. i believe the world will work together more than ever before on this issue- look at what the world did with the coronavirus. indeed, the pandemic, along with the election here in the us, has also kickstarted attention towards climate change. gen z and millennials know the pandemic and cc are connected. more young people voted than ever before this year. that’s amazing.

who knows what kind of tech will come in the next decade? i’m sure, as someone who’s not an expert on these things, that scientific solutions will come along that we can’t even fathom- solutions to cut emissions, to convince lawmakers, to provide green energy, hell, to capture carbon (tech i’m particularly excited about). 

this little essay isn’t an excuse to not act. it’s a call to assist in any way you can, but to have hope in humanity. we’ve overcome unfathomable things before, each one worse than the last (atomic bombs, hitler, etc). the world is watching, and people will soon see that greener countries are getting richer, greener cities are happier (and also richer), and states in the us that emit the most co2 (new york, california, basically the most densely populated) are also the most likely to embrace their own green policies! 

tl;dr: i argue that the urgency of climate change, like the coronavirus, will spur even more people around the world to act quickly and therefore succeed. there will be tech we can’t even imagine that’s coming down the pipeline. if humanity works mostly together on this issue, we can solve it. we can fix it. climate change getting attention in mainstream media is only a good thing- so many more people are aware of it in 2020 than ever before. even the existence of this sub is a good sign that people, most importantly, care.",0.9952

industrial activity constitutes a notable dispense of greenhouse gas emissions. the industrial sector emissions result from diverse processes. in the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), the authors included a brief introduction of the industry chapter, in which they described the origins of industrial emissions: 

emissions from industry (30% of total global ghg emissions) arise mainly from material processing, i.e., the conversion of natural resources (ores, oil, biomass) or scrap into materials stocks which are then converted in manufacturing and construction into products. production of just iron and steel and non-metallic minerals (predominately cement) results in 44% of all carbon dioxide (co2) emissions (direct, indirect, and process-related) from industry. other emission-intensive sectors are chemicals (including plastics) and fertilizers, pulp and paper, non-ferrous metals (in particular aluminum), food processing, and textiles.",0.3527

0,"next steps for my career working on the climate crisis response- msc in data science or a specific climate change policy course?  (reposting as last time a comment that seemed useful was deleted before i could read in full)

i have a humanities background but experience working with climate change/sustainability-related ngos and activist groups. my most recent experience was as a climate change policy research assistant (for local government policy and comms strategy).

i'm an advocate of participatory democracy and localised solutions to climate change, and have recently decided to narrow my job search to this area (this has always been my passion but i've just realised how many public sector jobs are opening up in this area due to many areas holding citizen's assemblies etc! i'd previously considered this a very difficult area to get stable and well-paid work in)

i also have adhd and have been trying to move my career into a slightly more technical area as that seems to fit my learning style better than more 'essay-based' type stuff. so i've been reviewing maths for quantitative analysis, learning python - i also really enjoyed the analysis part of my last job. at one point i took an interest in nlp, but i'm aware there may not be many opportunities in this area outside of the private sector (although rudimentary thematic and sentiment analysis was a part of my last job).

i know that a lot of people want to work in this area and it's competitive. i'll see if i have any luck with this batch of applications, but i've been considering going into further study to improve my chances and escape the more admin-y roles. so i'm wondering whether i should focus on technical skills and do a data science msc, then try to apply this to climate change research and solutions, or whether i should just do a specific climate change policy msc. which do you think would be more useful/open more doors?

most of my experience this far is in projects and events management and marketing and i speak french, spanish and some mandarin too. if that means anything. i started a very theoretical degree in security and development last year but i've paused it and am considering not going back as i found it very hard to stay motivated to write 3 theoretical essays per term and since my adhd diagnosis realise that it's probably going to be impossible for me to get through it with my sanity intact. i really loved my research assistant job though, as it was more applied and technical.

tdlr; i want to move away from admin and events management if possible, but keep working on the climate crisis response. i have some climate change policy research experience. will an msc in data science or specifically in climate change policy open more doors for me? i have adhd so work best in an applied and technical role.",0.994

however something that's always bugged me about it is how hard it is to find arguments against it. i feel like i'm not getting the full picture.  the lack of info i'm exposed to, even when i seek it out, coming from the other side makes me more skeptical of climate change if anything.  the amount of mocking ""climate deniers"" throwing out the ""98%"" figure, ""consensus"" etc.. all feels dishonest and more like they want to silence opposing views. both sides feel extremely manipulative, tribal and political.

 i remember growing up hearing 2010, 2015, and 2020 were all these years when x would happen, florida's coasts would be underwater, glacier's in glacier national park will be gone, ski resorts will cease to exist by 2020, winter will be 2 months long, most the ice in one of the poles will be gone, im sure i'm forgetting some. so the scientists were wrong? or were they just joking? but they're right this time and we should panic? why are they immune to being mocked? the climate change deniers i heard back in the early 2000's were more accurate in saying that none of this would happen than the scientists talking about these doomsday scenarios were... 

yet, when i hear someone now saying anything that might argue in the slightest that its not as big of a deal as its made out to be, they get crucified for it. even among my friends if someone expresses doubt they're dismissed as being stupid.  

again i for the most part believe in climate change, its very hard not to, but it feels like my belief if based on not hearing the other side, fear of being mocked for being open to hearing arguments against it, and desire to fit in and just accept it. it feels terrible to even know i can have a belief in something based on those things, but i'm human and imperfect so i do. 

i've heard endless arguments proving it, but i need to hear the other side so i can make up my own mind and actually come to whatever conclusion hearing opposing arguments has me come to.   i do remember a friend a couple years ago sending me a couple debates from some scientists arguing against it that were very interesting, but i was too scared to actually listen and entertain it back then. trying to dig those up is very hard, maybe i need to stop using google but it seems insanely hard to actually get to resources that give the other side a fair voice.

when i was an undergrad took a seminar class way back in the early '90s and became fascinated by the topic

back then (when atmospheric concentrations of co2 were around 350 ppm) learned about orbital dynamics (i.e the milankovitch cycles) was the primary cause of periodic ice ages, and that co2 had the ability to trap infrared energy

so basically always kinda knew that man made climate change is a very real phenomenon

you can either sign it with your name or anonymously. if you are okay with it, we would like to know what country you're from.

at the current pace of the sustainability movement, we are going to be dealing with changes to climate for the coming generations whether we like it or not. food security may not be a concern in much of the developed world (economics aside), but our kids and grandkids will definitely see the consequences of the accelerated degradation of the second most important resource after water: soil. 

how do we make the shift in our agricultural practices and soil preservation? is it encouraging urban micro farming? perennial forest gardens? grants for replacing lawns, growing your own food, or improving your soil quality on your land? emerging sustainable permaculture business? government policy change? all of the above would have many positive effects: co2 reduction, improved soil, food security, reduced erosion, positive mental health, on and on.

0,"here's a story about how my country in the middle of the globe, changed causing distruction! so i live in the middle of the earth, a place where wild animals and beautiful species derived by their nature of beauty and their breathtaking looks, i for once enjoyed looking at those beautiful plants that grew wildly, and plainly.

one day a war that struck this place shook its grounds, destroyed the lives of others, made it uninhabitable! of course, every war has its ends and beggings i for once never experienced such dramatic effects of it. only but after a brain that grew larger and so do my feelings and thoughts became more justifying. another day passes, for the people of the country and it was a special day, a revolution gets put together and we saw a change that lifted the spirit of the people, made everybody smile and cry experiencing all emotions, what has been the first time in our history to ever see peace.

later that post-war, people started to think of the possibilities, there mind only grew more expanding to different ideas, looking at the horizon as the sun sets and all people tucked in their beds comfortably, having hopes for a better tomorrow, a tomorrow that consisted of a more reluctant more positive day, only to wake up 10 years later brushing their teeth, getting ready for work, realizing something that in that morning, it was a dark one, a cloud of smog appears, red colored and looking evil, it was the most polluted 7 days they will ever come to witness, looking at the country as if something so big and had changed as if the people's spirits and motives have shifted towards one thing and that is more, more land, more vehicles, more ambition, that was the day have people realized it's a situation of doom and gloom, 7 days after the government restricted cars and any vehicles from operating, things turned to the better.

now, this sounds vaguely positive thing that happened, this story was supposed to bring the truth the real reason the real darkness. now i have always thought of my self as never being an ordinary person and is what i thought the world saw me for who i was, the world looked to me in a shameful way because of my weird unwanted way of thinking differently, a way that i never understood for years. one day i return home from school feeling weird as if a big clump in my throat had formed, i lose my sense of appetite, not even looking at the food, soon i realize that feeling was agony, realizing that i was experiencing a terrifying feeling in my chest that night, noticing that feeling had to be something worse something unexpected.

now 3 years later i was right the pollution in my country had worsened so badly where people have to wear masks to even set foot outside, 190aqi on an average day, consisting of mostly pm2.5 particles and pm10, high levels of o3 on a bad day, the time that i've mentioned the red colored sky, was indeed a wildfire situation, the pollution at that point peaked at 215aqi, although we've had 6 wild files for the past 3 years.

this story ends with me at age of 18, i now have given up hope, i now don't realize the problem of this country anymore, not imagining the future having better conditions! losing hope i have become what i have avoided and tried to fight... now i say ""sorry"", to my old self, i promise i'll try to change once i see the opportunity to do so when the people decide when it's enough. i wonder what a world of sustainable nature can look like besides watching planet earth documentaries, i wonder how beautiful it can be how nice it can feel! one day people, we will rise for the better and we will become stronger than ever, seeing this in the future would be honestly the most thrilling time of my life, just hope it happens because it's the only option.",0.9794

i think it's worth mentioning that i live in the uk.

i'm just wondering what the best solution is. i understand that there's not enough land to sustainably provide all of these large meat eaters with enough food.

so is the solution to cut down meat so you're only eating a very small amount of varied meat a week, rather than meat daily? or is it take meat out of the equation completely?

**""reductive solutions""**

\-constant push to reduce consumption on all levels

\-reducing water consumption to the point of rationing

\-constant encouragement reduction of energy usage 

\-making smaller and smaller beehive like apartments or communal housing as the ""trendy living spaces of the future"" to save the planet

\-promotion artifical food sources, bugs, soylent (i don't have anything against soy, i like it, but the general gist of ""nutrient paste foods, 

\-if this violates rule 1, i'm sorry, but attacks on private property and ownership, constantly saying collectivized or public transportation, living, nationalization, are the best ways to reduce climate footprint.

\-attacks on oil and gas hoping to shut them down immediately causing backlash, ignoring the immediate consequence.

\-talking about how we can't let the third world develop or it would speed up climate collapse, ie obama saying we can't give air conditioners to people in africa.

\-and then there's largely useless and detrimental ""virtue signaling"" things, banning plastic straws, saving the turtles/whales.

\-the irrational fear of nuclear power when it and it's derivatives that eventually require investment into the field (fusion, thorium, etc. bad news, if you want your clearn thorium or fusion, you need to invest in the nuclear sector as a whole to get there first.

\-a general ""anti-human"" mindset, the view that we as humans are evil, that we're a plague on the planet earth, this is common in many environmental groups, joking about how it be better if all humans were dead. that human consumption and ambition are bad things that need to be suppressed and quelled to make people more humble, reduce, reduce, reduce.

the ""how dare you"", the ""humans are evil parasites"" that anti-human mindset.

**xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx**

the thing is most of these things have merit, yes, many of these strategies are valid, but i feel like the reductive mindset dominates climate change solutions to the point that it crowds out the ***additive solutions***

**heavily if not completely innovation driven**

\-heavily investing in nuclear power, make more energy that 10 billion people could ever want

is that normal? i've seen a few articles about how it's hard for humans to care about the future as our brains are wired that way, but it's nothing to the extent of what i feel. i'm trying not to be a horrible person, i have pretty low empathy in general. i genuinely do care but i can't feel any emotions towards it.

0,"cheap and easy ways you can help the environment today 
1: download ecosia
ecosia is a search engine similar to google but every 45 searches that are made, 1 tree is planted. it is almost identical to google and is pretty fast. so far, ecosia has planted over 100,000,000 trees worldwide!! 

2: shop local
avoid big supermarkets like woolworths and coles, or if you're american, avoid places like walmart and stuff like that. shopping local reduces carbon emission by not having to ship everything all over the country to stock the shelves. if you can't shop local, make sure the products you buy use local ingredients or don't use imported ingredients to keep shipping to a minimum.

3: cut down on meat
now you don't have to go full vegan, you can even skip this step but at least keeping in mind that the livestock industry is responsible for a large portion of all carbon emissions. 

4: after lockdown, use public transport when you can
public transportation keeps cars off the road. the people in one whole block of traffic could fit in just 3 busses with some seats to spare. this is also cheaper than a car since you don't have to pay for fuel. 

5: recycle as much as you can!!
this is a bit obvious, but recycling keeps trash out of landfill. composting is good too if you're looking to start an edible garden which is also eco friendly. 

6: start a garden
if you have a backyard, make use of it with  p l a n t s. this puts oxygen back into the atmosphere and is the most local food can get. to start a garden, all you need is; tools (hose, pitchfork, trowel), pitting mix and mulch, compost (storebought or homemade) and of course, seedlings (store bought or home grown with seeds in a pot). this will cost around $100 so if you're willing to put in the hard work, this is a great way to help the environment. oh and one more thing, dont use chemicals in your garden!!!

this is the closest i have got to a white winter for many years. i'm in my twenties now, and every winter when the family gets together, my mom still tells us about how snow used to get up to the waist when she first came to denmark. how she would just sit in her apartment and stare outside and watch the snow that had been falling for weeks. and even now as grown man, i still listen to that story every time, even though i know every word of her story. and now every winter, we just pray for a white one. but i know it will just be another winter with the same old story. but i still have a few months left imagining a white winter.

also, given with current events and having to avoid such plagues, it rather difficult to get out somewhere (*if there were an event*) and partake in saving what is left of the climate. i mean how do you get involved in something like this? this isn't an activist type of job where you stand up to the weather and say ""**heel, sit boy!**"" because honestly, we've been trying this for quite some time now with our society and corporations, and that it just goes through one ear and out the other. i mean, how long have we been fighting *cc* now, since 1870 (*when carbon emissions were documented*), and became much more noticeable in the '70s?

to me, it just seems inevitable, like it was meant to happen, regardless of human being there or not. at some point, the earth would have killed itself off, but we're human and we are good at either destroying things or speeding up the process. anything we touch seems to be irreversible.

1. what are the causes of climate change?  
i know that greenhouse gas emissions (co2, no2, etc etc) are the major criminals, and are emitted during manufacturing and production of electricity. what are the industries that contribute most to these causes?  

2. do the general population have a significant effect on these causes  
do our daily habits like electricity/water usage, air-conditioning, use of plastic bags have a significant impact on climate change as well?   

3. is there anything the general population can do in their daily lives to help? conflicting answers on yes or no.
4. is consumerism a major factor? general consensus: yes. is there any way to reduce this?
5. which form of transportation has the biggest issue? international air travel, cruise ships, long distance shipping burning impure oil, public transport, cars etc, which of these are significant?  

6. china vs usa, cn has the highest emissions, but has much lower per capita emissions. usa is a close second, with insanely high per capita emissions. who should put in more effort/who is in the wrong?

i'm an american looking to potentially move out of texas due to the obvious climate change here in this region. but everywhere has its drawbacks.

cleveland, or the great lakes area as whole, seems like a solid choice, but there are some issues. here are the best ones i can find, feel free to contribute.

\#1 precipitation. scientists have confirmed up to 40% more precipitation in the area as a result of climate change. this translates into (part of the year) more snow, which can wreak havoc on homes and businesses if #1 too much snow falls at once or #2 snow falls earlier and earlier.

\#2 water quality. while one of the strengths of being on lake erie is, well, water, that doesn't necessarily translate into potable water. because of the increased precipitation there have been more instances of water contamination caused by nitrogen runoff from all the big agri nextdoor. so yeah lots of water but you would also need to have a water purification system and other systems in place.

\#3 ugly. cleveland is ugly and looks like it basically sucks. 

any other major issues? i feel like this area is probably the best in terms of longevity, but i could always be wrong. to the west you have tornado alley, which is moving northward at a rate of 500 miles per 30 years. and to the west of that you have wild fires that will continue to ravage that part of the country. to the east you have the coastline, which will be inundated with up to 8 feet of sea level rise by century's end, followed by more frequent and higher intensity hurricanes, like sandy 2012. and the south... i won't even go there.

what are guys are witnessing is just the final result of the battle about co2 emission theory cause global warming, climate change or not ?!  
 

the result is very clear, the answer is no.  
 

what happen when corona virus lock down?  
 people stay at home, much less work, thus less co2 emission produced everyday.  
 so the co2 emission in 2020 is smaller/lower than co2 million produced in 2019, for sure.  
 

but guess what?  
 the natural catastrophe disaster is stronger than ever, much more worse than in 2019, and 2020 is not yet fully up.  
 

\-record fire in the amazon forest.  
 \- doomdays wild fire screen in california, usa.  
 \- record rain, floods in china where you got 60+ straight raining days.  
 \- record typhoons, storm in korea where you got 3 big typhoon in a span of 20 days, while that nation got very little typhoon before.  
 

that is the result you get for real life less co2 emission produced.  
 

climate change is a too complex subject for mortal human can fully understand, let alone “gambling” in it.  
 it such as waste of time to debate co2 emission subject for the real life result speak for itself.  
 

**the question now is which natural disaster you want to see and face in real life:**  
 1. a sea level slow rising but can be predicted and see.  
 2. a sudden death disaster event such as super typhoon, earthquake, tsunami, volcano eruption.  
 

some part of the world sea level is up, but some part of the world there will be more living zone.  
 all you need is migrate to that new area.  
 

but if you got sudden death natural disaster events like super typhoon,earthquake, volcano eruption, then you got very little to no choice.  
 

the problem now for this civilization is that,most world leaders with big ego will most likely do not admit their mistakes but will fight till dead.  
 they are fighting to keep their ""elite/leaders"" useless title.  
 

it is similar to the fact that i am the real world savior, but guys denying it.  
 when i ask who else can be the savior or what the savior in your opinion,you guys cannot give an answer but only said “the savior will coming and it is not you”. ok fine, you guys can continue live like that till your default dead.  
 instead of admitting mistake and change, you guys only blaming others and do not open your mindset.  
 

it is tough because after becoming “adult” people have little less memory space in their brain till their old age, that’s why it is hard to change.  
 

the stupid non-sense corona virus ncov event must end right now, if not you guys only get more hash natural disaster event never seen before, and much worse than sea level rising.  
 

stop blaming and craft other theories like the gods did that, the people in the lock down angry cause that, etc.  
 

my deadline is still till only **15-09-2020 september 15th** **2020**.  
 i am not threatening with nuclear weapon.  
 i only telling you my future choice and action.  
 whether i able use thought to command natural gods is another funny question.  
 

remember that all the ancient prophecies telling you that only the savior can save you and give you the right direction in life.  
 

it is about faith, but if you do not have faith in me, you guys cannot change your default death life from the beginning. because the purpose of the life game is that you must change you, not seeking direct help from others.  
 

i am only here to give you little extra knowledge extra option to help you find the right direction to escape the matrix of life. the final choice is still yours.

0,"any way to capture and process co2 into carbohydrates right after production? i was thinking about how we do in-fact have mechanical photosynthesis, and it works 5x more efficiently than algae, 10x more than the average plant. yet to simply capture co2 from the atmosphere and use light for photosynthesis would be slow, but also expensive as you'd have to build so many units for it to barely make an impact anyways.

&#x200b;

however, what if there was a way to capture co2 and other greenhouse gasses coming from energy production at a fossil fuel plant? is that possible? because from there this mass of gas would be fed to mechanical photosynthesis machines much more efficiently and could result in 0 net carbon outputs if all of it is eaten up. then the products can be used for things that don't break it down to co2 again (aka not eating it).",0.8472

the internet is a wondrous, expansive and frightening place. groups rally around causes, self organize and educate one another. here, we find others who think like ourselves and share similar beliefs. sometimes, the outcome is a major win. for example, a group of folks from the lgbtq community successfully tracked down and salvaged the last known copy of the first lgbtq video game. on the other hand, the outcome pushes for major setbacks. e.g. communities rallying around movements of climate skepticism or worst yet, racism and hate. 

a little about me. i studied ecological economics and sustainability in school. my reason was simple. people think with their wallets. if we can make the right choice (sustainable choice) the cheapest and sexiest option, then everybody wins. truth be told, this is a lot harder than it sounds. the myriad of complex systems dynamics that make up modern day climate problems are overwhelming at best. having completed school and failed at landing my first job in the world of corporate sustainability, i fell into a role where i’ve been building creative communities for a fortune 500 company for the past 5 years. while on the surface, this job has nothing to do with my degree and my personal convictions, turns out, it’s been incredibly rewarding.

the bright side is this. over the last 5 years i’ve experienced and harnessed the power of community. with the proper framework, support and guidance i’ve seen communities organize, grow and self regulate. i’ve watched members equip one another with the knowledge and inspiration. better yet, i’ve seen these communities rally around larger goals in creative and innovative ways.

i want to do this for climate change. rather than read about what others are doing, let’s be the ones driving action. there are millions of scientists, economists, students, creatives, executives, bar tenders, musicians, lawyers (the list goes on) who want to make an impact. i propose we can use the internet to organize a large & impactful community of informed and convicted climate change movers and shakers.

if you ask between a petrol/gas car vs a electric car, which one will bring natural catastrophe faster, sooner to this civilization, then my answer is electric car !  
 

the science and theory say that: co2 cause global warming, cause ice melting and to root problem of the “future nature mega disaster”.  
 it sound very logical because when you burn fire near ice, it will melt, if you burn woods in your house,you will get warmer, so co2 is the problem.  
 

hey what if metals, technology (including everything made in lab house) is the direct cause of climate change.  
 

why don’t you ask why and how metals go rust?  
 it is because of air, fire, water.  
 

so the more metals, technology stuffs on the surface, the more natural catastrophe disaster come to you.  
 

the theory co2 only maybe “correct” about ice melting, but what about storm,earthquake, tsunami, volcano eruption which was happened many timesin the past?  
 

use your common sense and pick the correct theory.  
 **co2** vs **metals, technology**.  
 one theory only “maybe correct” about 1 catastrophe event.  
 but other theory satisfy all the natural catastrophe events.  
 

if you ask why the metals on the surface go rust then it is the “unripe product”.  
 a small little air can do it, so with high amount of quantity require a lot of air (storm, tsunami, floods).  
 

why it melting? then the answer it is because it is not the “original products/materials of life on earth”, simply like that.  
 

most of word leaders are digging the grave for this entire civilization by gambling on the wrong co2 theory.  
 

technology, science cannot predict the right temperature, when rain come, what wind direction, and cannot know the secret of life exist  beyond human eyes and any kind of technology.  
 

go ask yourself, your friends and compare both theories above and make your own conclusion about climate change global warming subject.

**there are many type of war conflicts going on earth in 2020, but mostly only 4 types:**

 **tier 4:** between people about what is correct or wrong, good or bad, etc. about certain events like a sport match, a scandal, a movie, etc.  
 

for me the world savior, all of them are very easily to resolved.  
 and the corona virus ncov covid is a golden opportunity to end the religious war, and tell people the true purpose of religions was for studying, education.

- total co2 in atmosphere, 2020 = ~30 trillion tonnes (30,000,000,000,000t). 
- total co2 output by human activity = 40 billion tonnes (40,000,000,000t/yr)
- at 100years of current output = 4trillion tonnes (4,000,000,000,000t) would be added

the religions was came in the past to teach people, to give people better direction in life, to give them hope about better future, better world.  
 

nowadays the humanity is in the darkness again where people are instead of learning, studying, build up their knowledge to grow like god, they are chasing for illusion not important stuffs such as money, wealth, title, technology.  
 

it is the time to relive all religions, to unlock it full potential, because it is the best way to teach people about life, to help people get out of stupid conflict in life.  
 

all kind of war caused direct or indirect via religions because of humans simple do not understand the true meaning of those sacred teaching from the highest stand point.  
 

some beings, groups, entities were trying to make religion conflict just want to people the do more research, to study more about religion, but mortal humans have limited memory storage.  
 

the complex complicated of each religion is beyond even their followers to fully understand it, let’s alone the outsiders.  
 

there are a lot of hidden teaching in many religions not yet brought to light.  
 **examples:**  
 \- why those monks in buddhism need to shave all hair.  
 \- what is the human sin in christianity, jewish.  
 \- why there is a ramadan event every year in islam.  
 etc.  
 

the religions have 2 part series, part 1 is blind follow and part 2 is critical thinking, deep learning and understand why do this action,why practice that activity.  
 

if you want to make it better,easier for the people to study, to understand, you must treat it like a big project. but instead of using money to make money, you are using money to make people to study religion more, to have a better life.  
 

**here is an example how it should be done:**  
 **step 1:** setup, form 2 or more version of your religion with different target people.  
 such as:original vs foreign, old vs new, short vs long, complicated vs simplify, no explain vs explanation, etc.  
 

**step 2:** using various strategies to attach people to study to learn to understand your religion.  
 like: spend money to make competitions, challenge contest, to crazy thing like religion degree, etc.  
 

here is to learn of why do this do that practice, not to worship pray or follow.  
 

the rich arab royal families in the middle east should spend money to explain others about the true pure islam, they should not spend money for the useless football club.  
 the same go to the jews, other royals, rich families.  
 

above is a quick framework of how to make all religions better than ever for the people to easier learn, to study.  
 i am not get paid to do the detail job, so do not expect me to spend time and energy to help your religion for free, you guys must do by your own.  
 

if any beings, groups, entities want to have any discussion about the religions and other life matter, the only place i will answer is at forum **freejoy.aimoo.com**, but with very limited time to **september 15th** **2020**. after that date, i am off the internet and see the natural catastrophe to come !

try it out! put a cube of ice in a cup of water, and let it melt. after some time the level of the water will decrease!

 there can be other factors that actually increase the sea level and counteracts this one. this is a very complex subject which people don't have yet enough knowledge, but still it is worth arguing.",-0.4806

if you really want the world have peace the you must know what is the correct divine condition to fight for, so you can easily overcome any kind of evil entities,deities.  
 

many secret societies, organizations are wasting their time, fighting without the correct objective goal. that is why you have the world is chaos mode in 2020 where many national leaders have moral level below animal beings !  
 i am not going to describe it anymore for the real life fake virus pandemic event speak for itself.  
 if it was for education people then it must come with different direction already.  
 

**what is the divine condition for world peace?**  
 the correct one must be true not just in the year 2020 only, but in any timeline throughout history as well.  
 and that one is “piece” nations !  
 peace and piece, it is quite similar, and that is the way to go.  
 

now, why don’t you craft theory about smaller piece nations when a world instead of have only around 200 nations but instead we have 1000 nations.  
 

the reason we had physical weapon wars in history and economic/information war in modern era 2000s is because the people who in charge of many big nations have too much power and have too little enemies. that’s why the ego and the human dna come into effect.  
 

so if the west, or the east or any kind of entities/societies really want world peace, they must change many objectives such as “human rights”, “economy” to “smaller piece nations”.  
 

**many of you may ask what is a size of a piece nation?**  
 the answer is that 1 language 1 nation but must come with free will volunteer not by force, that is the way to go and not to go.  
 

the usa can start with rebrand their nation as a union like the european union, where each states will become smaller nations with more rights. the same go to the china, russia, india as well.  
 

i am not going to debate with any of you for above is the perfect divine condition for real truly world peace.

why should we keep exposing ourselves to the constant stress that this way of life demands of us? we could live much better and at the same time cause less damage to our environment. this would require us to rediscover the art of idleness, which was highly valued at other times. 

idleness requires free time. this is more than leisure time: it is time free of constraints, empty time that can be filled with what the moment offers. caught in the daily hustle and bustle, it is difficult to develop new perspectives. you are so busy mop­ping up the water that you don't even think of turning off the tap. in order to get a grip on things at any time, your hands should be free. being idle means to have time to do the right thing at the right moment. and not much more.",-0.1331

>the ipcc has estimated that **aviation** is responsible for around 3.5 **percent** of anthropogenic **climate change**, a figure which includes both co2 and non-co2 **induced** effects.

so i'm aware that that includes contributions to climate change like the altitude at which the co2 is released, etc, which makes it worse than just the weight of co2 emitted. so we have 3.5% per year for ""aviation"".

in my opinion, aviation includes freight and military planes. they aviate, don't they?

does anybody have any data on how this 3.5% breaks down (or grows) in terms of commercial airlines, freight and the military?

if most of the 3.5% is either our food coming in to keep us alive, or the dod (world's largest operation / employer) and all world militaries pumping co2 in to the air with no oversight, why should normal people feel bad about a small amount of travel?

obviously there are arguments to be made for people who take it too far, fly short distances, fly every week, ""have to"" fly to the la office to attend a 30-minute meeting, etc etc.

\- part 1 here i really mean is that have a fair community people support each other when “necessary”, but you cannot control enslave and treat them like animals.  
 \- part 2 here i mean everybody should have some room of freedom, free choice when they need, so they can self discover the earth game.

 because they are not mortal humans but they are super beings have lived on earth for many thousand years and still observing the earth game between mortal humans.

**here are the result all of you are waiting for:**  
 \- changing bedroom and bed condition so the body can have direct connection with earth nature.  
 \- changing wearing clothes from plastic polyester to 100% organic material such as cotton/hemp.  
 

the direct connection with earth nature is like you walking barefoot on the clay or sleep on the sand.  
 the bedroom wall will be made by natural material such as bamboo, hempcrete, clay, etc.  
 the bed you are sleeping in will be made with tree part.  
 

many of you may wonder what is the benefit of above method.  
 the answer is that:all human body have ion- and ion+, when you have direct touch/connection with nature, the “unwanted ion type” will secret return back to natural environment. so that your body will be more balance and feel stronger, have more energy.  
 

you can do your own research on this subject on search engine, there are some videos already talk about it.  
 

the goal is not just raise awareness of the public, but also save planet earth from natural catastrophe.  
 

the house material will be built with another material but with cheaper price, instead of now almost all toxic hard concrete, so as the wearing clothes and other stuffs.  
 

above method is the only want got approved by super deities, natural gods. all kind of other “solution” like vaccines, drugs made in lab house will never be allowed to be used. all the super deities will do everything include casting floods, break building, earthquake, tsunami, etc. in order to prevent it.

i have studied global warming for over 40 years. it is by far the most terrifying thing we face today, not the pandemic serious though it is. covid 19 may kill hundreds of thousands. climate  change will kill tens of millions if not all of humanity. it can\`t now be reversed. how can i be so certain?

back in the seventies professor james lovelock and paul ehrlic two of the greatest ecologists  of our time were warning the world of dire consequences if it didn\`t change its ways. more recently they said ""the boat has gone over the niagara"""" every ones dead but don\`t know it yet """"  implying it was too late for man to save the planet, or rather to save themselves why? there simply wasn\`t the political will to deal with it.  military spending and gdp was far more important to governments even though it was costing the earth.                                                                                                                                                                                  jimmy carter was so concerned that when he became president he ordered the top scientists in america to research global warming the last line in their report ? if we don\`t act now (1979) it may be too late!!

so have they acted? what do you think? what has happened these past 40 years?                                      1   the world population has gone from 4 billion to 8 billion

2   co2 levels have gone from 280 ppm pre industrial to 415 ppm thus causing the greenhouse effect

3   methane, a gas much more deadly than co2 is being released from melting permafrost, landfill, the ocean floor, rivers, lakes and cattle, etc

4  three of the most polluting industries have never been busier. fashion, cement and plastic production

5  sea level rise is increasing more each year resulting in displacement of millions of people

6  in june when england was basking in 33 degrees it was 38 degrees in the arctic. in february it was 21 degrees c in antarctica. most terrifying of all siberia on may 22 2020 was 30 degrees c above the 1979-2000 average, phenomenal heat causing permafrost to melt at unprecedented levels!!

7  disasters once described as 1 in a 100 year events are now happening every year even twice a year

8  7 million tons of plastic enter the oceans every year endangering all aquatic life

9  the amount of co2 entering the atmosphere every day through mans greed is equivalent in weight to over 20 million elephants!!

  because the industrial revolution began in this country i wanted to see what effect all this co2 was having on temperatures in england and much to my surprise i discovered records of temperatures in central england dating all the way back to 1650

   the record before t i r was 10.5c mean temperature in 1733. in 1990 the record was now 10.65c. so in 257 years the record temperature had only gone up  a mere fifteen hundredths of one degree

   how could that be with all the co2 we were spewing out? there was only one obvious answer. the earth like the human body was wonderfully made and able to take punishment but only up to a point.    that point for the earth was reached in 1990. !! since then our planet has suffered severe decline.    imagine if you will a co2 wagon traveling at 5 miles an hour for 257 years until 1990. a wagon coming toward you at that speed poses no danger. you simply step out of the way. frighteningly that wagon since 1990 has been hurtling along at 105 miles an hour. catastrophe is inevitable.

   can we look to trump, putin, xi, and the many other despots greedy for power and domination to turn this crisis around. they haven\`t even turned the pandemic crisis around, something much easier.  

 if god doesn\`t exist neither will any of us in the next ten years. at some point in your life you will most probably have asked for the solution when you said the words ""thy kingdom come, thy will be done ,on earth as it is in heaven,"" only if there is a god who cares can there be any hope for us and the only planet we call home, our beautiful earth

if you want to have a better understanding about natural weather event such as floods, earthquake, tsunami, volcano eruption or global warming, climate, etc. you must know the basic earth map.  
 

the earth map i am talking about is not the geopolitical map between nations, but the whole system relate to the earth environment you are living in.  
 

**there are 3 layers on the earth:**  
 1. the sky.  
 2. the earth land.  
 3. the sea/ocean.  
 

the air, energy and organic chemical constantly go around from up to down to up by a perfect balance setup by the earth creator.  
 

all the natural catastrophe only come when that balance is break, when at least 1 layer have problem. and the problem is “blocking” the flow of the air/energy in that system.  
 

from the ancient time till now, the problem is mostly usually the earth land.  
 all because of stupid, cannot control actions, activities from all kind of different beings.  
 i am not going to discuss the past history many thousands to millions years ago, but today i am talking about humanity only.  
 

**there are 3 major mistakes humans made which directly affect the environment:**  
 1. hunting wild animals.  
 2. mining and using metals on the surface.  
 3. create artificial chemicals/stuffs.  
 

the problem is that they are using but cannot control it.  
 do you know what the earth system trying to do by flooding, storm, earth quake, volcano eruption?  
 the answer is melting and dissolve back those “stupid stuffs” that blocking the air/energy flow of life on earth.  
 

**in hindu, there is a teaching that “people should burn their personal stuffs when do not use anymore”.**  
 

how many years would take to dissolve back those stuffs if you only bury it to the land?  
 it is depend, from few days with organic foods to many thousand years with those plastic clothes, bag, chair, etc.  
 

but the earth system do not care, it only do whatever it take to balance the system.  
 that is why you have global warming, climate change !  
 the reason is not about producing too much co2 to air.  
 the root reason is not to burn the “blocking” hard-to-dissolved unused stuffs back to the system.  
 but many nations are burying those unused stuffs instead of direct burning.  
 

wearing organic clothes vs plastic clothes vs go naked.  
 stay in nature with bamboo house vs stay in concrete house in the city.  
 when you feel hottest, when you feel coldest, go ask yourselves !  
 

this is not just personal theory craft, but i am using the sacred religion teaching made by gods and real life result to explain it to you guys.  
 

the current virus pandemic is the last warning from nature.  
 when you are trying to lift a heavy stuffs, if you do not stop, your hand will going to bleed.  
 

the bleed here is very similar to a volcano eruption !  
 

humanity in 2020 can deal with floods, rain, storm but cannot able to deal with volcano eruption, you must remember that.  
 

this is the best lesson about climate change global warming subject i can give you guys.  
 if you guys still cannot understand and waking up, then the natural disaster will come in the very near future.  
 

you can reach me for any discussion at forum **freejoy.aimoo.com**.

lately i have been having a really hard time being able to keep my mind crippling-anxiety free regarding cc. i keep hearing and reading about how human extinction is upon us and societal collapse is going to occur in the next few years and it is really hard to try and not get swallowed by anxiety and suicidal thoughts caused by these takes. is there really something that shows that the world may end in the next few years or are these assumptions just the result of journalistic sensationalism and just people missing the nuance of cc? there's a part of my mind that thinks that while worrying cc will probably not affect us so (relatively speaking) terribly (at least in most of the northern hemisphere) during most of our lifetimes, and i assumed that was the default scientific (i may be wrong tho, i have heard this from several of my uni professor) consensus. likewise, i understand that the 10 years until 2030 to change the world thing is more of a comprehensible benchmark than a doomsday prediction; however, the doomer takes in my mind have become extremely difficult to ignore or rationalize as being sensationalist or unreal. i just want to know if im correct in seeing some views like these as being sensationalist, and if some of you guys have been feeling the same, and if so, what have you done to try and get over this doomer anxiety. or maybe i am wrong , idk i just need some guidance to ground myself into reality. i can understand that cc is real and i will probably see some effects of it while im alive but its sometimes hard not to envision cc as a cliff, which is my main problem rn ig. im no climate scientist and most of the literature sometimes seems a little esoteric to me.

one last comment, i just noticed that some of the lines i wrote make it seem as if i have an attitude of ""it wont affect me while im alive/where i live, idc lol"" but that isn't what i believe in. i try to personally reduce my carbon/environmental footprint as much as i can so we can mitigate cc as much as possible during and after my lifetime (im 20). also, if my sentence syntax and redaction appears a bit choppy, im sorry, this doomer anxiety has wrecked me bad, my mind is still messy and it was really hard to put my thoughts into words, im sorry.

a simple chemistry experiment is to place ice and water in a beaker with a thermometer.  record the thermometer readings with time. \[\*1\]   the temperature reading will be 0c (32f)\* until the last of the ice has melted.  then it will rise slowly to room temperature.

now repeat the experiment, but this time direct a heat lamp onto the beaker.  again, the temperature reading will be 0c (32f) \[\*2\] until the last of the ice has melted, but the added heat will melt the ice faster than before.  then the temperature will rise faster than before, and will not stop till it has exceeded room temperature by some amount.

the same thing is happening to the earth, but earth is a more complicated system than a beaker of ice-water.  nonetheless, when all the ice in the world -- the sea ice and the glaciers -- *all* has melted, the temperature of the earth will rise to some unknown level. \[\*3\]  

whatever that level might be, the temperatures of many regions of the world will no longer support life as we know it -- crops will fail, people will die from excess heat, etc.  it will not be pretty.

of course, were the sun's heat somehow reflected back into space, the world would cool again.  that can happen if massive amounts of dust are thrown high into the atmosphere.  one volcano eruption possibly could cause considerable cooling. \[\*4\]  several volcano eruptions might do ""better.""  and apparently a warming earth might lead to more volcanic activity.

however, there's another mechanism to get dust into the atmosphere:  nuclear war. \[\*5\]  when all those people can no longer survive in their excessively hot countries, they'll migrate.  migration will lead to conflict.  conflict may lead to war, possibly nuclear war.  nuclear war may lead to global cooling.

call it the gaia hypothesis \[\*6\] with human assistance.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\*notes:  

1. if you use a recording electronic thermometer, this can be done without taking the time and trouble to watch and record.
2. strictly speaking, the temperature 0c / 32f is correct only for pure water.  for salt water the temperature would be somewhat lower.  the conclusions are not changed by this difference.
3. possibly someone can or already has predicted the average temperature the earth will reach after all the ice has melted.  i don't know what that will be, but it is likely to be above the comfort zone for humanity across much of the earth.

&#x200b;

*""firstly, the degree of political polarization that has developed around climate change (in some western countries, at least) reflects the fact that disagreements about climate change are more likely to be about values than about the underlying science—even though the science is often used as a proxy for these value-based disputes. although values are fairly abstract concepts, one way in which they are instantiated is through formal political ideologies, which are likely to be more or less favorable to particular climate policies.""*

""*even casual observers of denialist activities likely notice an obvious pattern; with rare exceptions (e.g., sallie baliunas), the most prominent denialists are conservative white males. this is true for contrarian scientists (e.g., patrick michaels and fred singer), media pundits (e.g., rush limbaugh and glenn beck), think tank representatives (e.g., joseph bast and william o’keefe), and politicians (e.g., senator james inhofe and representative joe barton). within the ranks of elites, climate change denialists are overwhelmingly conservative white males. does a similar pattern exist in the american public?*

*a burgeoning body of literature on the social bases of climate change concern in the american public has emerged in recent years. such studies have analyzed the direct effects of political ideology, race, and gender, typically finding that self-identified liberals, non-whites and females are more likely to express concern about global warming than are their conservative, white, and male counterparts, respectively. the analysis presented below is the first to (a) consider the intersection of political ideology, race, and gender and (b) explicitly examine climate change denial.*

*...on one level, conservative white males in the general public likely perceive conservative white male elites to be their in-group. over the last twenty years, conservative white male elites have challenged the reality of climate change via conservative talk radio, websites, television news, and newspapers (e.g., wolcott, 2007). thus, we argued that conservative white males in the general public would be more likely than other adults to embrace and defend the claims of conservative white male elites....*

*...on another level, the work of jost et al. shows that conservatives—and we would extend this to conservative white males—strongly display tendencies to justify and defend the current social and economic system. conservatives dislike change and uncertainty and attempt to simplify complexity...""*

* **dunlap, riley e, and peter j jacques. “climate change denial books and conservative think tanks: exploring the connection.”** ***the american behavioral scientist*** **vol. 57,6 (2013): 699-731. doi:10.1177/0002764213477096**

""*it is often noted that individuals promoting climate change denial, including the small number of contrarian scientists, mainly criticize or “audit” the work of climate scientists (especially as summarized by the ipcc), and only infrequently contribute to climate science themselves. unlike mainstream climate scientists, who publish primarily in peer-reviewed journals, these critics typically employ a range of non-peer-reviewed outlets, ranging from blogs to the books we are examining. a large majority—97 of the 108 books—are self-published (33), published by a conservative think tank press (35), published by a conservative (or conservative religious) press (17), or published by a popular press (12), and are thus unlikely to have undergone peer review—particularly by individuals with expertise in climate science...*

*...notably, not a single denial book is published by a university press.*

*the general lack of peer review allows authors or editors of denial books to make inaccurate assertions that misrepresent the current state of climate science. like the vast range of other non-peer-reviewed material produced by the denial community, book authors can make whatever claims they wish, no matter how scientifically unfounded. in fact, the lack of peer review in the “denialosphere” means that denial claims are continually recycled, no matter how many times they are refuted by empirical test or shown to be logically untenable terms them “zombie arguments” because they repeatedly rise from the grave....*

*strikingly, many of these books not only provide fallacious critiques of climate science but also present an alternate reality in which global warming is a hoax created by a conspiracy of supposedly greedy scientists, liberal politicians, and environmentalists.*

*although mainstream scientists occasionally take the time to debunk some of the more visible denial volumes, the proliferation of such books makes it impossible for busy scientists to critically review most of them. thus, denial books are likely to continue to multiply, and many will receive considerable attention from sympathetic and scientifically unsophisticated audiences.""*",0.7791

i asked him about what he would want to be washington’s energy source, as he is against the use of bio-mass, wind power, coal trains, solar energy, dams and off-shore drilling, which pretty much covers every ground that i know of for energy sources. he did not give me any specific answer as for what his concept is, but did unsurprisingly direct me to michael moore’s climate change movie, which is where he most likely got this information. 

when i pushed a little more for his answer, he said that he was no expert, and did say some sensible stuff about the current energy source movement being corrupted by greedy ceo’s. yet more interestingly, he pointed out that where we could get good information is from researching... why the pyramids were built. that he believes they had high technology better than what we have today, somehow hidden in the pyramids. 

i find his entire thought process to be fascinating, and am interested in what his thought would be from documentaries with actual proven information rather than conspiracy theories. in the process i hope to maybe direct him to a more sensible way of thinking about conspiracies? not that i’m worried about him being elected, i just want to see if that is a change that is possible. 

simply, are there any good documentaries that focus on good and very unusual energy sources, or anything in that direction? hopefully something that would appeal to a conspiracy theorist, not something that attacks people who have a tendency towards being paranoid of major information sources?",0.9878

0,"how does this work? i’m pretty ignorant when it comes to climate change. i’d greatly appreciate an explanation of how rising global temperatures will spell the end of civilisation as we know it. 

at present, my understanding is that the order of events is something like this:

1. global (air and sea) temperatures rise

2. polar and glacial ice melt, raising the global sea level

3. rising sea levels wreak economic havoc by:
a.  causing mass migration from low-lying population centres
b. necessitating the construction of costly sea barriers around wealthier coastal cities

4. rising sea temperature causes disruption of long-standing oceanic currents, leading to dramatic localised climate change. this is a problem because affected countries must alter their economies and economic output to reflect their new climate reality. this itself is a problem because the change in climate will occur faster than economies can keep up. 

5. mass famine and starvation will result from the reduction in arable land brought about by rising temps. 

6. if newly suitable countries do not pick up the slack in terms of crop production, global food supply chains will dwindle. this will result in more starvation, and possibly war.

7. sufficiently fast temperature changes (such as what we are now experiencing) will lead to the destabilisation of local and global ecosystems, and great reduction in biodiversity. this is a bad thing because we rely on these ecosystems for food. if they collapse, global food supply reduces to a point where the present global population cannot be supported.

8. corollary of (6) and (7): global temp increases will not lead to the creation of enough new arable land to grow enough crops to support global civilisation in its current form. in other words, arable land lost will not be equal to arable land gained.

puerto rico seems like a great place to start since they are in desperate need of stronger infrastructure, destructive hurricanes are frequent, their systems are not interconnected as they’re on an island, and the scale of the project is feasible to do quickly. as a bonus - investment would be good stimulus spending and set them up for a potentially independent future. i envision it would become a proving ground for technologies such as:
- state of the art power grid 
- advanced sea walls and water diversion
- tidal, wind, solar and nextgen or modular nuclear power

i've struggled with confidence and anxiety for quite a while and i have found the transition to uni to be somewhat difficult, although i've found my housemates in 3rd year to be really supportive and in particular my housemate sophie.  


with climate change being front page news, with many local governments declaring a climate emergency, i decided that i wanted to do something to help raise awareness whilst also going out of my comfort zone and challenging myself. i managed to find out about the world naked bike ride - a fantastic peaceful protest ride in towns and cities across the uk to raise awareness for the vulnerability of cyclists and remove dependence on fossil fuels.  


after some research i decided to take the plunge and take part in the london ride last summer. after chatting about it with sophie she decided that she would also be keen to take part as a keen environmentalist and also to provide me with some support. the ride is classified 'as bare as you dare' so we both agreed that we wouldn't go the full hog but we would ride in our underwear.  


we got an early train up to london with our bikes and made our way to sunny hyde park and joined everyone else for the start of the ride. we both got ready in hyde park where i stripped down to just my boxers whilst sophie stripped down to just a pair of knickers.  


the ride was absolutely amazing with so many people being so supportive with a common core value of helping to protect the environment, and the ride helped me so much with my confidence and anxiety issues - i'm so grateful to have sophie as a friend and i would urge anyone who is struggling with anxiety to look to their circle of friends for support! university can be difficult but there are always people who are willing to listen. 

i managed to get an action shot of sophie during the ride (which she is cool with me posting) which now cheekily takes pride of place as a magnet on our fridge (a silly christmas present from last year!)

people should be worth the same and derive their value from earth's value.
  
the total of current money and ""debt"" floating around and stupidly being hoarded by an extreme minority, its worth nothing compared to earth's value.

 late society has exponentially plundered from it's value and feeding it to an abstract entity, gravely damaging our own  ecosphere and climate system in the process.
 what is the purpose of a society?
the purpose we give it, derived from the challanges it has. the purpose is restoring and protecting the ecosphere and warranting proper life for everyone and the next generation, for the challange is the hostile environment the collective damage done has produced. a chance to fix our mistake.
 a possible far goal is to achieve climate control and became protectors of biodiversity, pay the debt to earth and make it more valuable with our actions. we owe it to the planet and ourselves. 
 
 this is where the value of earth comes in, to know the extent of our debt, now debt it's not an inherently bad thing, is a feature of a working economy. an economy is a tool for it's society, it should work accordingly, and in our case it is intertwined with our goal.
 we would still have a way to trade our work and objects, pay for services, give presents, invest. every human would initially have a value, part of the total value of earth, divided by the number of humans.
 the purpose of a government is to move towards the goals, administering the tasks required for it to function and move towards society's goal, every decision should be make to start reversing the course of the damage, this is the way to pay what we borrowed from earth, policy will become a global issue with equal participation, and by adopting the purpose it would better our immediate conditions. it's a win win for everyone involved. even if we don't achieve the goal, the steps needed to get there will start bettering our society and personal life. 

  i have been thinking about the specifics of the value of one life and global society using a currency of the average of one day of life, linked to the earths value called a terra, earthconomics currency, a universal crypto currency. people trade with each other in percentage of terras, every human is borned with the same number of terras. the value of one life. the maximum terras one human can be worth is 1.e of one life. tasks that restore damage or take value from it generate one terra over a day.  art and science, physical and intelectual labor would be valuable, damaging activities would be paid in oneself value.",0.968

i know that south asia is going to get disproportionately fucked (for eg. bangladesh is starting to see it already) once shit hits the fan, and while the indian government is doing more than most countries for climate change, it's still not doing enough. the population is huge (going to be #1 come ~2025) and the poorest sections of the population are going to be displaced.

my original plan with my life was philanthropic in nature- i wanted to help financially underprivileged  people with the same mental issues as me the resources to treat themselves. so i'm torn between staying in india and working on this plan, or jumping ship with my family before it strikes the iceberg- and possibly at least partly working on this plan some ~10-15 years from now from a distance.

0,"the old guard of climate change has killed our planet.   

here is why we our planet is doomed: 

imagine a group of junior high school students is touring columbia university and that group happens upon dr. broecker or dr. hansen. one such prepubescent has the temerity to ask one, or both of these titans if they had considered the possibility that one or more of their conclusions on seminal work could be wrong due to some factor or another. 

being the grandfather of climate science, i believe dr. broecker would admire the young upstart's pluck and even appreciate this student's level of interest... at first. 

now imagine dr. broecker being forced to contend with this child daily. forced to share an office with them, debate them, and all the while the one child turns to two, then to four, and so on. increasingly, he must not only share his raw data but also answer infuriating questions like ""what’s this symbol mean?"" 

eventually any adult let alone a brilliant scientist is going to treat this child like any other child and tell them a bed-time story. which of us parents have not bargained on a friday night that, should the little crumb-cruncher go straight to bed this instant, she could skip school tomorrow in favor of ice cream and play? yes, a clever trick that works great for a while. it is a fact that the child must sleep for their health and well being. they cannot conceive of rem, growth hormones, circadian rhythms, the water used to weave of the cotton in their blanket that somehow isn't wet now or the filthy coal burning hundreds of miles away making it harder for her to breath and pushing a fatal amperage of alternating current in the pleasant nightlight by her bed. these and a limitless universe of other items we need not explain to them. of course, we could say to our children,"" you don't have school tomorrow because it is saturday so be happy about that and go to bed."" the full stick of truth prods with a less pointed end, does it not? no, the false premise serves everyone's sanity much better. 

and here is why we are doomed: this little allegory dissolves out of parallel when you name the insidious little brat the american public and you realize that the american public has all the grown-up’s money. just like the harmless trick worked to get them to behave before it will not work now. it doesn't matter that we were right; we lied. it is a fact that the american public must listen or perish but we took a short cut and with push back are reminded the sharpest stick of motivation is often pointed on both ends. oh, we could try force and we are trying force, paris accord, the courts, epa, et. al. deniers won't understand that while you may hold a child down for her shots, (let's pretend they give their children vaccines) you may not hold her down for her health. i imagine that in denier ""parenting"" they have probably tried it but realized quickly no one would receive rest or trust. 

all of our top climate scientist need to walk out front and center, deliver the full truth and reconcile with their lies so that the american public will trust us again. we treated them like children, they complied for a while, they learned that it wasn't true, at least not for the exact reasons we told them. we cried wolf so many times and now that we need them to help save us all they laugh at us. now we are now trying force them. it’s not going to work because it isn't the american public that needs to wake up before it is too late. it is us. we need to rid ourselves of all of the cheap tricks and those that played them. show the american public that we know that this was wrong and then they will believe what we say now. they are ready for the science, they are awake and paying attention. we need their help to let our planet rest and recover. we will not get it on the current path. 

this will never happen unless we throw out the old guard. the older scientists know that they were right in their conclusions and don't care about our lives, they won't live another 20 years anyway. just as a parent does not step down because they tricked their child to sleep for their health, why should climate scientists step down of their own accord just because they delivered a lie that was based on the fact that we have to let our planet heal? 

we need to do it for them and not just those mentioned here by name, they should not be a convenient scapegoat for the entire industry of climate fright that has cost us so much credibility. cast them all out. do not attend their lectures, take classes that include their textbooks, boycott the entire old guard of climate science now before it is too late.",0.9952

for starters, i am aware that community solar projects exist. i titled this community solar because i lack a better description at the moment.

so, i had the idea of implementing a crowdsourced solar project/projects. solar is notoriously expensive for many consumers, and impossible to buy for people with houses in bad locations, or for those renting a location. my idea is that you could ""buy"" solar, by contributing to a certain fund/nonprofit. this nonprofit would then handle purchasing solar power, negotiating with utilities mif needed, etc. those that donate to this fund ""own"" a portion of a solar panel equivalent to their donation. for instance, if someone donates 10 dollars, and a panel in this instance costs 100 dollars, they would ""own"" 10% of that panel(less, actually, to account for other costs such as maintaining the panels, installing fees, etc). by buying in bulk, solar could then be bought for a significant discount versus individuals purchasing solar. less converters needed, etc. 

&#x200b;

for buying a portion of a panel, they then get a return of whatever power that panel makes. for instance, if the panel generates x amount of energy, worth like 2 dollars, they get that two dollars \* the portion of the panel that they own. 

&#x200b;

of course, there are many drawbacks to this idea, i am sure, but i wanted to throw this out there to see others' opinions and thoughts!

now to get to the point...
i was just thinking about various things and i realised that when they make sea level changes it's not just the typical type of climate change they are seeing.
explanation as follows...
gcse level science tells us that when you combust something you create co2 and h2o. so the sea levels riding may well be as much the extra water we are creating as much as the ice caps melting.
before you reply, just think about what happens to water that is used. either plants turn it into glucose by photosynthesis or it returns to the water cycle, but as clarified by a lot of climate changers, we don't have enough trees, so water is not being used up permanently as fast as it is being made by burning and breathing (and pretty much every other commercially used scientific reaction as a by product).
so it's inevitable that sea levels will rise and this will change other climates, accelerating everything that is already happening.

this reading had me thinking, is this all being planned out and manipulated by faceless people behind the scenes; a global conspiracy of sorts.  i read lots about various secret societies and groups all seeming to have plans for a future planet.  many of them morphed into today’s think-tanks and lobby groups.  i thought this was a way i could try to forecast what the future may look like.

eventually, i came to the conclusion the future will not be like some jetsons cartoon or 1970s utopia vision.  it is going to be far far worse than that for billions of people and very likely the poorest of them, which we are mostly sheltered from in our western countries and lavish lifestyles.  it seems as if these consequences were of no real concern for those in power, and even to many of us, that added to my thinking that some grand conspiracy was in place to change the world for select few, the so-called 1%ers, the neo-aristocracy.

but despite all that, i came to realise that there is no conspiracy and that the world is not being manipulated, it is just been exploited by a few and we are all trying to be part of the select few in order to escape our lot in our lives.  witness the massive and growing migrations of refugees, etc. trying to get to a better life and bring their families with them as well.  so we are all really part of the problem by our striving to better ourselves.  it has been said that we need two and half earths if the whole population were to live like us westerners.

so back to the trends i was informed about in the 1970s and what has been happening since.  the biggest trend is the population exponential growth and the consequences thereof.  i read recently that if we added all the weight of all land mammals together, 96% of that would be us humans and our livestock and only 4% are wild mammals.  so big is our impact on the natural world.

this impact on the natural world, our exploitation of natural resources for industry and pleasures, has caused so many problems we are now in the 6th mass global extinction.  but that is not all, our fish stocks are reducing, our arable soils are losing suitability for growing crops making us use even more polluting fertilizers, our forests are making way for cash crops and more and more farming lands for our needs.  we are also using fossil fuels at unprecedented levels to support our growing populations for power, for industry, for construction, for transportation, for chemical and plastic production, which contribute to our pollution.  strangely all that pollution too, in the air is acting like a shield from the sun delaying some of the current warming trends, some are even suggesting we send even more up as a sort of geo-engineering.  but also concerning that pollution is killing our sea life, and its ability to absorb our waste.  we even take in a teaspoon of micro plastics a week into our bodies affecting our health directly.

i have always doubted co2 is the primary cause of global warming. many of those doubts still remain, because i do not understand all the science involved. but the theory of evolution, gravity, relativity, and others are very much facts to me. what i do know is that the growing human population is growing faster than the earth can cope with and impacts we are having on the planet is significant. so i am not going to blindly believe that co2 is the cause, (i drive a very polluting bmw 330i m-sport regardless, and will do for a very long time), but i will continue to advocate for reductions in consumerism and associated waste, pollution into the air, land and water. i am seeing continual changes to the climate, whose causes seem debatable, and the massive impact that is happening on humanity, especially the poorest. i am now very concerned that anything we do or plan to do, will not have any significant impact on making a change to the climate in our lifetimes, but if we can at least be on a cleaner, greener path in the long term, a large portion of humanity will be able to survive. 

so we have the skeptics, doubters and deniers, many of which are sponsored by the fossil fuel industries, which help to influence people who have their ‘confirmation biases’ confirmed that there are no problems.  i too was influenced by these people a few years ago now.  they have done their part to delay any meaningful actions for decades and concerned scientists first warned about these future problems in 1992 and more recently in 2017 with graphs showing how things have gotten worse in just a mere 25 years.  we now have famines, heatwaves, floods, storms, droughts, city water shortages, forest fires, as now regular ‘once in a hundred years’ events happening almost yearly around the world.  i am not going to convince you in this one post, but i hope like me you may make your own investigations and discover what i have concluded after many years of research, that we are headed to an uninhabitable earth.

so yeah, things have gotten so bad and the effects are now so noticeable to even most lay-people, but in actual fact it is really much much worse than what we see as many scientists have reported already.  the feedback loops are only now just starting, and we have what are ‘known unknowns’ effects leading to ‘unknown unknowns’.  so the future is concerning because it really is unknown and i worry for younger generations.  so lets try to be good custodians of the planet for the next generations.

“science communication” recently is almost an oxymoron, with much arguing and yelling past others but with very little communication of the science involved.  the so-called “hockey stick” reconstruction of temperatures of the last millennium is rather prominently featured in the public noise, and may be a useful starting point for a discussion of moving forward.  for, contrary to the more breathless expositions, the hockey stick is largely irrelevant to the main scientific issues of climate change, assuming importance primarily in the shorter-attention-span parts of the public discussion.

the expectation of globally averaged warming from rising greenhouse gases rests first on radiative physics, verified by laboratory, field and satellite observations and physical calculations.  an equilibrium warming of just over 1oc results from a doubling of co2, all else held equal.  however, the warmer air tends to pick up more greenhouse-gas water vapor from the ocean and land plants, and to increase absorption of sunlight by melting reflective snow.  these feedbacks increase the expected warming from doubled co2—the climate sensitivity—toward 3oc.  changes in clouds also matter, and to a lesser extent in vegetation, with clouds dominating the uncertainties.  if the feedback strengths have been overestimated, the climate sensitivity is pushed down towards the co2-alone value; if underestimated, the interactions among the feedbacks might allow very large sensitivity to perhaps 10oc.  

combining the climate sensitivity with the large potential co2 rise from burning fossil fuels and other human activities, and assessing the impacts of the resulting warming on economies and ecosystems, motivates the public discussion of wise responses.  however, such a large range of sensitivities is not especially useful to policymakers, prompting additional studies to narrow the estimates. 

climate models are central in moving past back-of-the-envelope estimates.  the physics of the atmosphere—conservation of mass and energy, gas laws, radiation transfer—and the characteristics of the earth—size, rotation rate, solar energy intercepted—are programmed into models of varying complexity.  no model can resolve every raindrop or every tree, requiring parameterizations that are adjusted within the ranges allowed by data to match the climate for some chosen time (but not to match climate changes over time)—the complexity of trees and buildings is replaced by a surface roughness parameter, for example. these models then successfully reproduce earth’s climate—the prevailing westerlies and hadley circulation, oceanic gyres with westward intensification, arctic and antarctic oscillations, and much more—and some at least have been applied and proven successful in weather-forecasting mode.  importantly, models have not been produced that both match earth’s climate and have very high or low climate sensitivities. 

additional model tests are made against changes in climate over time.  many aspects of models are considered, but we’ll focus on sensitivity here.  causes of climate change are estimated (brightness of the sun, sun-blocking effects of particles from explosive volcanic eruptions, changes in distribution of incoming sunlight in response to features of earth’s orbit, etc.), and used to force climate models.  the model output is then compared to independent estimates of the actual climate for the time considered, based on recent instrumental data or on paleoclimatic archives.  because the climate feedbacks act in response to many forcings—warmer air picks up more water vapor from the ocean regardless of why the air is warmer—response to changes in sun or in volcanic particles provides useful information on response to changes in greenhouse gases.

the instrumental record of the last century provides a tempting target for model testing. however, the very large human-caused source of atmospheric particles, and the uncertainties about the effects of these particles on longevity and brightness of clouds, preclude highly confident tests.  low sensitivities can be excluded, but very high climate sensitivity coupled to a large enhancement in cloud reflectivity by particles is possible; uncertainty about ocean heat uptake further complicates interpretations.

the response to a single volcanic eruption such as mt. pinatubo has proven to be a more-useful model test, as has the cooling at the peak of the last ice age; both have well-characterized forcings, and well-reconstructed responses.  additional older events, such as the warmth of the paleocene-eocene thermal maximum or of the cretaceous, are also useful.  very high and very low climate sensitivities are excluded by these events.  a warming of ~3oc for doubled co2 or slightly higher appears reasonable, with uncertainties smaller than ~2x (although higher sensitivity is obtained if the concept is defined to included slow changes in ice sheets and other features).

the cooling from medieval times (~1000 years ago) to the little ice age (variously dated to one to a few centuries ago) is a tempting target for model testing, because it is so well documented in certain regions.   unfortunately, the data are spatially highly clustered with large regions undersampled, and the changes are relatively small and somewhat uncertain.  the (in)famous papers of mann et al. were a pioneering attempt to statistically overcome the spatial sampling problem.  the authors chose to rely on especially well-dated records, and thus primarily on tree rings although including some others. absolute dating is essential for assessing the climatic response to single volcanic eruptions or short-lived clusters of eruptions; however, discussion continues in the scientific community on the fidelity and calibration of tree-ring records for slower changes.  in light of the small climate changes involved, even small errors could affect the model test. 

the tree-ring reconstructions yielded what is generally called the hockey stick, with little natural change from medieval times to the little ice age, followed by recent warming to temperatures above medieval levels, although with notable uncertainties that precluded strong conclusions and with the most-recent and warmest temperatures primarily resting on instrumental data. subsequent work, including analyses admitting lower-time-resolution records, generally has produced similar results, although with some showing more variation from medieval to little ice age. 

as noted above, the comparison of medieval to modern temperatures is not highly instructive, because of the large uncertainty in how much greenhouse-gas warming has been offset by the effect of human-produced particles on cloud reflectivity.  the relatively small “hockey stick” change into the little ice age in response to changing volcanoes and sun tends to indicate a relatively low climate sensitivity, but the uncertainties are large enough that the hockey stick does not figure prominently in our understanding of climate sensitivity or our projections of the future. 

the large paleoclimatic database from the last millennium certainly justified the effort to homogenize the data for model testing.  it is unfortunate that as yet strong model tests have not been achieved, and it remains possible that additional work, focused especially on the poorly sampled southern hemisphere, could reduce the uncertainties sufficiently for more-useful tests.  for now, the tests are broadly consistent with our other insights, and show no major problems with the leading climate models.  if the not-much-change “hockey stick” is used without consideration of the associated errors, it indicates a climate sensitivity on the low side of most other tests, and thus slightly less concern about future human-caused warming.

there exists a very large disconnect between this scientific significance of the “hockey stick” and its appearance in the popular press.  we suspect that this is related to the comparison between medieval and recent warmth.  although the difference is not highly statistically significant and is even less significant scientifically, a slight change in reconstructed medieval warmth can be used publicly to state “temperatures now are warmer than at any time in the last millennium” versus “medieval temperatures were higher than they are now”.  for anyone getting their information primarily from such “sound bites”, the difference appears large and important.  the irony is that the popular interpretation, that cooler medieval time means more concern about global warming, is reversed from the more-accurate scientific interpretation.  the strong public correlation between disdain for the hockey stick and resistance to action on global warming indicates a major lack of understanding. 

the hockey stick very recently has come to assume a broader public role, as an icon for questions about scientific integrity in climatic research.  publicly released very short statements taken out of context, from longer emails taken out of context, from additional emails taken without permission of the authors, who were communicating without guarding their words against the possibility of being taken out of context, have been very widely distributed.  the debate about the fidelity of tree rings as linear recorders of medieval and recent warmth appears prominently, with one of us expressing serious doubts that the tree rings as generally interpreted successfully capture the full temperature-change signal.  the rougher edges of that discussion have not played well in the public arena. 

scientists surely face at least some of the problem in the mirror in the morning.  we have not found any way to convert the scientific discussion above to a sound bite, we have not succeeded in successfully communicating the longer version to policymakers and the public, and faced with repeated failures, some of us may be guilty of resorting to “warmest in a millennium”, too.  we have failed to generate those loud, consistent, comprehensible voices honestly communicating the science that might keep reality in the public eye.",0.996
0,"would the use of controlled, targeted and artificial algae blooms help reduce co2 content in the atmosphere? hear me out,

so, if our oceans absorb 25-31% of co2 in our atmosphere (not to mention other gases brought by rain), by process of rain, algae, seaweed and other such events. then if we create these circumstances artificially in a relatively controlled manner, the co2 content in our atmosphere would decrease.

however, this is a short term, road-to-recovery situation. there would need to be prevention of leachate, burning of methane from landfills, better waste systems (sewage and garbage) to mention a few. burning methane would help because methane is a more potent greenhouse gas.

this would need to be in an area with less sea life, or where algae blooms happen naturally, seaweed grows naturally etc. this would be done by spreading fine iron filings and other nutrients which are not harmful to native sea life. plus the seaweed could be used to feed people.

there's a huge confidence in our ability to adapt.

americans cannot insulate themselves from all the chaos that will be unleashed, and all the terrorism and migration and so on.

below is a conversation that i had with some scientists. 

i said:

>there is a cavalier attitude that i've seen of, ""we'll adapt. i'm not worried, if it even happens.""

>how can it be made clear to people that these disruptions will not be so easily adapted to?

one scientist responded: 

>if they don’t want to hear it, there isn’t any changing their mind.

>only people willing to change their mind in light of evidence are reachable. and for them, they just need be shown the evidence. in that case the strategy from persuasion theory is: keep it simple, easy to understand and short, but well sourced and with an explicit option of where and how to explore each point further should they want to. any other approach creates tl;dr syndrome and doesn’t get through.

the other responded: 

>the data show that most folks in the us and the world are at least partly on-board on the advantages of reducing global warming.  those who are not have been exposed, repeatedly, to the major arguments.  data show that those people primarily consume ""conservative"" media.  the arguments on national security, economy and employment may not work, but are statistically more likely to be important to such folks.  because efficient responses on energy and environment help economy, employment, and security as well as health, environment and ethics, you can start where people are...

and another response: 

>that's a good point to add: psychology proves motivation is more influential than facts. if people want a thing to be true, they will believe it's true. which drives all denialism too. so bringing up why it matters can trigger desire. hence, for example, the national security argument will trigger a fear response that will trigger a desire not to be in danger which can motivate finally considering whether the claim is true. various people will have different motivational triggers. so no single argument will work on everyone. you have to adapt to your audience.

>it can also be useful to take the street epistemology approach and instead of arguing facts go straight to epistemology: ""why do you believe that?"" continue asking that question until they start to realize on their own that their answers are starting to get weak. the downside of that method is that it's extremely time consuming and requires the extended personal attention of a single individual. not effective en mass.",0.9909

0,"is it known in the eco/co2-community that today we use far less cattle than 100 years ago? hi there,

i just read an article by which schools in uk will reduce the amount of meat served at lunch, because meat is causing climate change. for one, i am wondering if you people - who presumably like the idea of reducing meat consumption - are aware that some children need more calories than others. not all kids or people generally are average, some are taller and have a stronger metabolism (=boys!). they need meat to cover that as they would have to eat 10kg salad to saturate their need, but still be hungry. (yes, that's hyperbolic, but personally, i hate it when there's nothing ""real"" on my plate).

anyway, my main question would be the one in the title and i believe it's of major importance. because believe it or not, but today, there is per head far less cattle in the world than 100 years ago. the reasons for that are:

a) 100 years ago, people ate less meat than we do today, but it was still some 60% of what we eat in meat today.

b) we have combustion engines today, which means we don't need horses and oxen anymore in the military, police and generally the economy. until the grand mechanization in the 1930s, just alone the military needed some 100,000 horses every year. on top comes the police which nowadays mostly uses cars, but just imagine twice the number of cars in horses (because it's always 2 policemen per car). not least used to be the importance for horses and oxen for the private sector. just think of farming, where some 30-50% of the population worked. they all needed a horse to do their job, just as most of small craft shops needed a workhorse to do the heavy lifting.

all in all there were millions of horses and oxen more than there are today and they all needed food and they all were emitting co2 and ""co2 equivalents"", hence farts. that's why in total, today thanks to the combustion engine, the per-head footprint of cattle is much smaller than 100 years ago. 

do you know about that and if so, why is this ignored?

that would really interest me, because it baffling me that some people can't see this sort-of obvious angle. thanks!",0.9571

""everyone else is doing it, how would my decision make a difference?""

it's an easy idea for me to bite into. it tastes sweet and easy.

this is my first post here and i hope to add meaningful and constructive ideas to this community. i have posted this same post on r/youshouldknow and i hope it helps.

i wanted to write this a few months now since i've seen a lot of misconceptions about the subject of climate change and i wanted to correct the most dangerous ones in my opinion. i won't go into a lot of details here and i will make a lot of approximations to keep it simple and i encourage you to look things up if you're interested. i'll leave a tl;dr at the bottom.

as you've noticed, the title has two folds, (1) the nature of climate change and (2) it's impact.

in most peoples' minds climate change means **the planet is heating up** and since, for most of us, **weather** and **climate** are the **same thing,** ""if the planet is warming up, why winter is so cold?"" statements are predictably frequent and hard to dismantle.

to solve this, i think we should focus on thermodynamics for two main reasons, anyone with high school knowledge will understand it instinctively and it allows us to get strait to the source of the problem: **total energy increase** in the **system earth**.

earth receives a stable quantity of energy from the sun each day (on short time scales) but does not absorb it all, at the same time earth loses a quantifiable amount of energy to space. if earth gains and loses approximately the equivalent amounts of energy each day, we can say that our planet is **thermodynamically stable**.

now, the data shows that the system earth gains energy not by receiving more from the sun but (1) **absorbing more** from what it gets and (2) **loosing less** to space.

and since earth receives energy from one side and looses it from the other, **air and water will move from the hot zones to the colder ones to try to reach an equilibrium**. and since earth rotates, is inclined on it's axis, is not homogeneous, has fluids (water and air) and turns around the sun, these movements get very, very, very complicated and change a lot. but still, the aims stays the same: **have an earth with the same temperature everywhere**. and as you may have guessed, it's a loosing battle.

please note that **what matter here most** are not the actual temperatures but the **temperature difference** between the start (hot) points and the end (colder) points. **the larger the gap the more violent the exchange is**.

what this means is that earth will get **more dramatic** and **frequent climatic phenomena** since they have to **move more energy in roughly the same amount of time**.

let's imagine what this means for our species and other life forms. (the subject of point two)

let me get this out of the way first: **earth and the universe do not care about us** or any living species for that matter. **it's us humans who care about our own survival** and that's why climate change is an issue.

different species have lived and died on this planet and many more will do. the **key to their survival** is their ""**fitness**"" to their environment. **we are no exception**.

if we are no more fit to the new environment that is coming, our species and our societies as we know them will decline and perish.

our environment **does not** only include the other lifeforms that are directly beneficial to us like cattle and edible plants and fungi. it also includes what these lifeforms rely on to live and those too are in the same boat. chaos theory is in full swing here.

human exceptionalism is a myth than we need to kill to see the world as it is and have a chance to save ourselves.

the few chapters above mean that **saving other species is not altruistic**. **it is necessary to save our way of life** or at least **have enough time to adapt**.

so regardless of it's origin, climate change is a serious threat to the lives of many and to the standard of living to all humans. and like any problem, it will cost us way less to solve it early than late and we will have a lot more chance to succeed.

tl;dr. earth is heated unevenly and retains more energy than before. water and air ""try"" to even the temperature but since they have to move more energy from a lot of different places, violent movements of air and water become more frequent and intense witch is really bad for human life. human life is also dependent directly and indirectly on other life forms to exist and thrive in a complex system. breaking the system will kill many and make the lives of all more miserable.",-0.9056

0,"[meta] we need to change this sub. over the past weeks and months, we've probably all noticed the influx of bad faith posts and just generally shitty posts. there are a few types of posts that are prevalent which i consider harmful to this sub and the people looking here for information. and as a result of that, even though this sub is 24k large, it gets a lot less traffic than it really should.

# there should be a pinned post listing all the most common ""sceptic"" arguments and debunking them, as well as an all-out ban on sceptic activity.

the first and most obvious problem is the climate ""sceptics"" that come here and in a bad faith attempt to cloud facts and sow confusion. there's always a question floating around always following around about the same format. *""insert fact which on the surface looks somewhat bad for climate change"" - does this weaken your position?.* climate change is (sadly) a fact, it's one of those things which comes alongside the earth being round and evolution being a thing, and most of us here will fairly easily recognise whatever they're inevitably misrepresenting and might point it out. however, there are also plenty of people that come here to learn, and those people being shown with that type of content, without having the necessary basic scientific literacy that you learn later in life, will lead to bad results. i can understand admins wanting to have this place be a centre of the discussion, but this is not the case. the pinned message has always been ""don't be a doomer about climate change"", so the mods are definitely not afraid to take a stance. climate change sceptics should not have a place on the first sub you find when searching for climate change. they have their own little hole of being wrong.  

# there should be no place for advertisement from unverified initiatives, nor for so-called ""silver bullets"".  

this is something i also see a lot of, people advertising their social media where they claim to be some sort of authority or another. and more than that, charities claiming to be able to perform some kind of service or develop some kind of technology or whatever else. most of these are startups, and i dare say that most if not all will never reach a point of completion. these might be started with good intention, they might be started with bad ones. the point is that we don't know. i feel like these kinds of advertisements should not be allowed unless they have been verified and found to be proper and running initiatives, without that, scams and their like can run around and might even steal money from people legitimately seeking to help. instead of this, there should be a list of verified initiatives and charities for people to donate to and help out if they can/want to. in addition to that, it's also extremely hurtful to propose single solutions to climate change. there is no ""silver bullet"" or single practice/law/device that will solve this global issue. it will have to be a combination of many. silver bullets can be extremely harmful because this will always lead to people arguing against other solutions because ""my solution can just fix it without needing anything"". it's not a good thing, and posts claiming to have found a single solution to the problem are disinformation akin to scepticism and should not be allowed.   


# there should be a questions thread, overseen by people who have a clue what they're talking about. 

a few weeks back, a younger person came to this subreddit, concerned about the duration of his life because he/she believed that they and their family might die because of climate change. this is the sad result of the ""adult"" world bleeding into their life, causing confusion and terror. we shouldn't scare children with climate change, obviously. but the comments on this were almost painful to read. the highest-rated comment on this post advocated stopping eating flour, peanuts and ""all other toxic chemicals"". the next highest was a very blunt ""no"" with minimal explanation. the third and fourth were it's equal. only on the fifth comment did anyone actually bring a message of hope, normality and logic. this is what greta was talking about when she said that her ""childhood had been stolen"", and this was not the response this sub should have given when confronted with someone like that. this is another type of post i see way too often. i assume from a younger or less educated op, there come questions as to possible ways to deal with climate change. from digging a large hole to store all the melting seawater to asking if sea shell collection would affect climate change. these are not dumb questions, they are legitimate questions by people who take an interest in climate change, and they should be responded to as such, not with harassment or jokes. however, these almost drown this subreddit, and they're not exactly what we need right now as posts. therefore it would be a lot smarter to have a thread where anyone can ask any ""simple"" question they have about basic topics, solutions they haven't heard about or even questions on the ""deadliness"" of climate change

# there should be stronger controls on being scientifically correct. 

this is, again, reaching back to the previous bit. someone claimed that eating pretty much every type of food possible was harmful to the climate and someone should stop eating it. a lot of people come to this subreddit looking for answers after being confronted by some piece of bogus evidence from a sceptic acquaintance. and sometimes, or even a lot of the time, they are presented with the factually wrong answer at least somewhere in the comment section. there are people who will claim to be informed on this topic, and then just say some random bullshit because it makes them sound smart. this subreddit should be known for its helpfulness, not forgiving 20 different and conflicting answers. 

# conclusion

this subreddit should not be a place for ""arguments"" or ""sceptics"" and it should do better in the ways it represents itself to people who are just wanting to learn more. it should be a hub of teaching people the basics, a bright message of hope and a good way to learn and teach. there are plenty of people on this subreddit with an incredible amount of information, one that i cannot match. people with actual degrees in fields of science, and some absolutely great information and people to find here. it's just being absolutely snowed under by a large amount of bullshit, unhelpfulness and confusion.

i have learnt enough to understand what it does and it seems to be a viable method to sequester large amounts of carbon.

my next step has been looking at the best plants to grow on a mass scale in order to make use of ocp.

the first plant i came across was mvule (milicia excelsa), which appears to be the most efficient tree in terms of ocp, however also seems to be more of a lone grower so perhaps harder to farm.

my latest interest has been cacti, specifically opuntia/nopal (prickly pear). from what i can gather this is also very efficient and producing calcium carbonate and, unlike mvule, much easier to farm on a mass scale. 

is there anyone on here that knows about ocp, especially when used for carbon sequestration, and would be able to answer some questions for me?

as this may be an option for investment i am very keen to find the economic potential of growing a farm, perhaps of opuntia, for use as a ""carbon farm"". that being said, anyone with knowledge of opuntia being used for carbon sequestration will also be of great help. 

i look forward to any responses!

climate change has been fucking up the planet and obviously nature isn't too happy about it. and because nothing short of a pandemic will earn our attention, that is what we get. this pandemic, as i see it, is the best offer it has to offer to us to meet halfway. to tell us that it can anytime not only turn the tables but flip it, make it do a cartwheel and transform it into mongodb without even breaking a sweat. that it can pull the rug right from under your civilisation and laugh at the fallacy of hundreds of years of progress we think we have made. this might seem like the rantings of a mad man but here's my theory. it's 2 point:

1. the pandemic serves as a display of power and a cruel pointer to the joke that is the contest between the 2 parties. a 125nm virus and 7.7 billion of the supposedly most evolved race of the planet and we are forced to lock ourselves up. not even a snap of fingers. to show us that it won't hesitate to move up its timeline and not wait another 50 or so years to perform a house cleanup if we don't get our shit together.

2. there are losses of human lives and that's a huge blow. but the pestilence primarily is eating the economical and industrial culprits for breakfast. markets are dropping below sea levels. every progress we purchased with the price of the life of this planet is being burnt to smithereens. we have said that we have come to far, to slow down now let alone stop. that excuse is snatched away like a rook standing diagonally from a pawn. the move is ours. 

what we do now, what we make of this event is upto us. a lot of lives, some really good ones have been a collateral damage. i know video games have desentesized us to tragedies and landscape altering events and given our track record, once this blows over, we'll just use it to inflate the prices of history books of the future. but this is a way out. this is as 'convenient' as it's ever going to be. the world has existed an eternity before us and its going to after nature's done with its pest control. you're just another cockroach. you were never fit to 'save the planet', that's just your over-inflated ego. save yourself! there are so many issues within ourselves. racism, gender inequality, homophobia, class divide, unjust capitalism, corrupt democracy, animal cruelty; frankly i wonder we even got this far. every horrible thing on a scale that dwarfs whatever little pure and good we have left. i don't even believe in what we're trying to save here! 

nature is ambiguous and this is just a theory, not so plausible one at that, but the burden of proof is on us this time and the statute has run out on our ignorance. it's a death row from now on.",-0.9903

there are some obvious concerns when it comes to the impact that we are having on this planet. i’m struggling with the complacencies among the masses and political objectives. 

i live in australia and our government is destroying our country and contributing massively to the mass extinction of all things living. 

i believe that this is no longer a scientific conundrum that we are faced with. we have all the tools to put aside our fears and shift this mess. in my view i’m seeing this as a social and political issue that is stifling our chances to save this amazing ecological web of life that we live in. 

some of the questions i have are:

how do we effectively do everything we can in our individual lives to promote a positive shift? 

how do we inspire other people to actively be engaged and not be ignorant in these times? 

what are some of your methods for the emotional strain that this crisis causes? 

how do we stop our corrupt government from destroying our lands for greed?

any help would be appreciated, i am struggling and i know other people are too any advice would so greatly appreciated and any discussion is so welcomed in any direction. 

thanks 🙏",0.9827

i spent the afternoon on a nationwide call with the sunrise movement aimed at addressing the question, “where do we go from here?” for those of you who don’t know, sunrise is a grassroots organization that created a comprehensive plan in the vain of fdr’s new deal. instead of mitigating the fallout from the great depression, the sunrise movement’s purpose is to combat the climate crisis. their proposal, entitled the green new deal, is endorsed by bernie sanders and by climate scientists and progressive politicians alike. i highly recommend you read a little bit about it if you have the time.

i joined today’s call because i have been feeling a guttural urgency to act.  while the imperative that my mom and other activists of her generation  feel to get involved is directly related to removing trump from office, i have less confidence that any of the major threats we are facing will be extinguished or even addressed by the democratic establishment. 

i am feeling existential despair about how to make people acknowledge and truly experience the immediacy of the climate crisis. why won’t people realize that it is a threat to us at this very minute, in this late hour of our sunday, in every city and town in which we and our loved ones live. 

new york used to snow. my hastings friends, do you remember when we were kids, and zinzer park and the burke estate were blanketed in snow from december through march? that doesn’t happen any more. that was only 15 years ago. my nostalgia is underlined by the desire for things to be the way they are supposed to be. 

the climate crisis has to be the central issue of this campaign, this election cycle, this decade. what privilege i have to be so concerned about climate change, while my brothers and sisters are being detained at the border and are dying of hypothermia in the night. the climate crisis has to be our greatest  responsibility, because we are lucky enough to have our primary needs, food, water, shelter, taken care of. 

do you want to have kids? to the parents of my friends, to my parents- do you hope to be grandparents? do you realize how goddam irresponsible it is to bring children into a world that will look unrecognizably apocalyptic 1 decade from now if we don’t hault the wheels of climate change today. 

im not trying to make you feel fear. i am attempting to bring you into the conversation that i was part of this morning. at 26, i was one of the older voices on the call. this youth army has come up with attainable steps to address this crisis- largely but not entirely through the specter of our political system. the plan is three-fold.

strike on earth day.
work for bernie.
elect green new deal candidates into office.

if i have convinced one person to become involved, i feel so grateful. i love you all. i really do. let’s work together.",0.543

0,"could we come to prefer our altered climate?  imagine this scenario: the year is 2050, the world's last fossil fueled power plant has shut off with all electricity now coming from solar power satellites, all transportation is now battery powered, and all food is produced synthetically. the world will not get any hotter from anthropogenic activities but due to how long co2 lasts in the atmosphere, combined with the removal of aerosol pollution, the climate will remain 2.2 degrees hotter than in preindustrial times, with land temperatures standing at 3 degrees higher.

sea levels are projected to rise less than half a meter by 2100 from 2000 levels. a few dikes, made from carbon fiber reinforced self healing concrete that will last longer than even the structures built by the romans, ensure that the great cities of the world will remain high and dry for millennia to come. cloud whitening, done by having ships spray salt into the air to block out the sun and cool the waters below, snuffs out hurricanes. contrary to predictions, extreme weather has become *less* common.

changes in patterns of rainfall have had virtually no adverse impacts on life. with food now produced synthetically, there is no more worry about drought and places with little rainfall can inexpensively recycle wastewater or desalinate seawater. fears about insects being able to thrive in warmer temperatures where previously frost would kill them off have been nullified by gene drives, allowing all manner of pests to be eradicated. tree populations have climbed dramatically as bark beetles and gypsy moths were wiped out and forests have reclaimed the vast abandoned farm land all over the world. edit: the people of india face more heatwaves, but because of the country's rising affluence, almost all indians can afford air conditioning and deaths from heat stroke have actually dropped over the last 50 years.

the benefits of warming have also been notable. many places, most notably new york city, have been liberated from the burden of snow and ice as they have warmed enough to move winter lows above the freezing line. there are fewer heart attacks caused by shovelling snow, fewer injuries from slipping on ice, and fewer car accidents caused by slippery roads. communities have saved a fortune on snow removal and road maintenance. places that were once unbearably cold have become comfortable. because warmer air holds more moisture, rainfall has increased by 5% worldwide. the most notable change has been in the sahel where rainfall has increased enough to turn it into lush grassland. edit: the arctic is now passable to ships, greatly reducing journey times between europe and east asia.

overall, this warming has been beneficial and talk about removing co2 from the atmosphere to bring back 19th century temperatures has died down. people have come to like this warming.",-0.5704

fossil fuels, in the past more known as the key to higher life quality and prosperity, a way of obtaining cheap and affordable energy for everyone, is now akin to black death: it is lurking at every corner, silently sneaking in with its black claws into everyone's home, ready to destroy us and our planet at any moment. however, nothing worth having comes easy: we won't sly this dragon without making certain sacrifices. after all, fossil fuels make around 96% of the items we use today! i feel sick already! good news is, the banning era has begun with our efforts to eradicate the single use plastics, such as plastic straws and grocery bags. we must keep educating ourselves (unlike the climate deniers) to willingly accept what's yet to come in the following years - the great ban on the following:

* oil, coal, natural gas
* cattle
* affordable fresh produce
* ice transport
* cleaning products *(laundry detergent, mops, trash bags, etc...)*
* sanitary products *(shampoo, pads, diapers, toothpaste, deodorants, etc...)*

what do you guys think this is the case? i mean consumerism and capitalism exists across the whole world but there is something very specifically unique about countries like these? what do you guys think is leading to such a an outcome in the ecological foot print both at a macro level - industries, politics, military, law & enforcement, education and essentially at micro level - personal individual lifestyle choices, impulsive and neurotic gratification seek behavior, consumption of bland forms of media and art-forms, supermarket culture?  


i am very much interested in having a deep perspective on the individual lifestyle choices of the people residing from these developing countries. how different is their pattern of consumption from a person consumption behavior of a person from developing countries. let us take india for example, even this country has a great influence of capitalism and consumers which heavily rely on fast fashion and processed foods?

1. less shower.   
2. get local vegetables at a farmers near my home.   
3. eat less meat and make it more of luxury so i don't mind paying more for meat that are from animals in my area .   
4. use bike and more public transport.   
5. i got 3 older sun panels from my dad.   
6. we pay for green electricity.   
7. when we are not home or asleep we put the heater off.  


we have 1 car. i have to drive 20minutes to work. gf bikes to work its only 3 minutes so. 

i wanna give up more on car driving.. take the train more to work and winter sport holidays i wanna go with the train to the mountains (i live in the netherlands and europe has easy connections with the train). already bought a bag for my skies for easy transport. so i'm already giving up my car more.. 

what bothers me is that every time i think oke i get more green like example solar panels you just get backfired that also that is not that green as we think.   
if i could pay for electric car i would to that but that has to wait (also the way those battery are getting made is bad for the climate blabla..). but i want and need to step up more. watching the news about climate change makes me depressed.. 

what i need to know now is what is a good road to take and aim for a better footprint in this world.

* distance from the sun  
* albedo  
* amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere

this model was used to explain why the planet venus is significantly farther away from the sun than the planet mercury, and has a much higher albedo -- both of which should lead to a lower average surface temperature -- but it in fact has a significantly higher average surface temperature (to wit, because of the greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere).

one possible explanation for someone holding the opinion that climate change is not real or not due to human cause is that the person is just ignorant / dumb. but i realized this is just one possible explanation.

 i live in the us and know during the obama administration many policies were passed to combat climate change. these policies had no effect on my life whatsoever. they also didn't affect any of my family members or friends' lives. so of course, if someone asks whether i'm in favor of these policies, i would say yes. it's almost like a ""why not be in favor of these policies"" kind of thing. it's partially because i'm in a position of privilege in this case. 

but what if your job or a family member's job, and hence livelihood, is taken away because of a policy that combats climate change, without a reasonable replacement? that person, though smart, would be more likely to go with the view that climate change isn't real, or it's not worth combating, etc. if this is actually what's happening, then i'm sure many would sympathize with such a person and maybe even take their side. 

i was wondering if anyone have thoughts on this? or know if the scenario i described is actually a common reality or false? i know many coal mines were shut down in the last decade, resulting in a loss of coal-mine jobs, but they were replaced with renewable energy (wind, solar) plants, resulting in new jobs. but are the same people re-hired? or do these jobs require a different skill-set and education level that someone working in a coal mine not have?",0.9641

0,"global climate catastrophe at the root of the climate catastrophe lies man’s tendency to consume and man consumes in three clear ways and three distinct ways. man wants to consume the entire world and the entire world consists of human beings, prakratik beings which you call as natural beings and man-made things. man consumes all three and consumption of all three leads to carbon emissions.

when you consume another human being, what do you get? kids. and that is the biggest cause of carbon emissions. when you consume man-made things, again what do you emit? carbon, because whatever is man-made is made using energy and energy comes from fossil fuels. so, whenever you are consuming something man-made, you are causing carbon emissions. and the third thing is the consumption of natural resources. whether you are eating vegetables, whether you are a vegan or not, or whether you are consuming meat, all of this is highly carbon-emitting. even if you are vegan you will eat grains at least. where will the grains come from? they can only come by felling forests.

we need two things- fewer people and less consumption and both of them together.

you need a situation where there are not more than two or three billion people in the world, that has been scientifically calculated to be the sustainable limit. and currently, we are eight billion, we need to reduce it to two or three billion. and secondly, those two or three billion people have to be spiritual so that they do not have the tendency to consume.

unless you are spiritual you are bound to be living the consumption centric life. the very urge for liberation when it does not find an outlet becomes the urge to consume.

where does the tendency to consume so much come from? it comes from the misidentified and thwarted urge towards liberation. if you will not provide liberation to a man, his energies will flow in the direction of consumption.

think of it, whenever you go emotional you start releasing carbon dioxide. when you go emotional, you either drink and that is carbon or you go and have a party and that is carbon. now you see why lack of spirituality is the biggest problem because when you do not operate from a spiritual centre then you operate from an emotional centre. these emotions are what is causing climate change. and i am really surprised that so many people who are highly emotional are into climate activism. the entire problem is of emotions. you are so emotional about that next foreign holiday, right? that is carbon-intensive. you are so emotional about having a good nice nest of your own, that is carbon. you are so emotional about having two nice kids, that is emotion and that is carbon. emotion equals carbon in a big way.",0.9267

fossil fuel companies would fight to the death over a policy like this though, because it would hurt their interests.

carpooling was much more popular decades ago, but it declined after the 80s.
the carpooling scheme could be used to give people something like a tax incentive or a reward for carpooling to work/school/commuting to somewhere.

0,"under the concept of a ""carbon budget"", will emissions reductions by consumers make any difference at all? i was struck by an article by george monbiot some years ago (sorry i can't locate it again), where he talked about how, at the then-current climate conference (copenhagen, i think), the parties were not arguing about how much of the planet they could save, but about how much they got to destroy. increasing your ""carbon budget"" is apparently good news, it means you get to consume more resources and make more money.

recently i was reflecting on this and had a rather disturbing thought. but i am no expert, so i'm here to get a fact-based and evidential response to this query.

**if producers are trying to get the maximum carbon budget possible, will they not simply expand to use any co2 emissions saved by consumers?**

let's make up a little example to illustrate. for the purpose of the story, let's make a good-faith assumption that carbon budgets are meaningful, and that our nation will keep their pledges. 

i am a citizen of goodland, and i want to do the right thing. goodland, under the international agreements, currently has a carbon budget of 100. 40% of this is by consumers, and 60% by producers: industry, transport, and so on.

seeing as i'm concerned about the planet, i work together with my fellow goodlanders and we manage to cut our co2 emissions by half, dropping our portion of the national carbon budget to 20. yay! 

however, our country still has an overall carbon budget of 100. we could, in principle, celebrate being overachievers and use less than this. but in fact what happens is that the producers say, great, more co2 emissions for us! they expand their activities and emissions, maintaining the total national carbon budget at 100.

the outcome of this is is that our consumer changes achieved precisely nothing in terms of co2 reduction. i'm not saying that the reduction is negligible: i'm saying it's literally zero.

rather, what our consumer changes did was to shift the costs of reductions from producers to consumers. our campaigns to ride trains, insulate houses, eat vegan: all that merely created extra wealth for the producers. given that, on the average, producers are wealthier than consumers, this means that the actual effect of consumer campaigns to reduce emissions was to transfer wealth from the poor to the rich.

so is this a realistic scenario? do i misunderstand how this all works? is it something that is accounted in current agreements? is there any empirical study of this issue? some help would be appreciated!",0.9917

this could provide advantageous for american warmongers who normally wouldn't support climate change prevention policies but if activists started pushing society to see war as a justifiable action to countries not reducing emissions it would give us warmongers almost a free pass to declare war on whichever non-western country they want by using the climate angle. since older people aren't going to see the disadvantages of climate change, it makes it difficult to politically motivate them to do anything about it but wars are something you can justify to old people for bettering the country through annexing territory, privatizing infrastructure and colonization. meanwhile, old people don't actually fight wars so they have nothing to lose. of course it's young people who end up being the casualties in war but young people are also the ones who're going to experience the negative consequences of climate change so they have less to lose anyway.

war might increase ghg emissions in the short-term but wars also lead to reduced population which is good for reducing ghg emissions.

first of all, i’m not an anti-climate change theorist. i do believe that many of humanities actions are having an adverse effect on the environment (plastic, fossil fuels, etc) and that collectively as a species, we need to all pull our weight to change some of our behaviours. 

my argument was that even if the sea levels do continue to rise, something as drastic as london being underwater will not be realistic in a time frame as short as that. even if the sea levels did rise at an extreme rate (and that’s a big if), i personally feel london will have the resources and infrastructure to deal with it. i then went on to say how the sea levels rising is very likely to be a periodic spike rather than a permanent increase and that there are hundreds, if not thousands of variables influencing sea levels. it would be an overly simplistic view to use one or two variables (global warming and short term trends) to conclude that london will be underwater in several decades. 

i hadn’t read any of these articles myself so i didn’t attempt to list any specific facts as i did not possess them. my point was purely related to the london being underwater in such a short period of time as being extreme and ridiculous rather than climate change as a whole. i believe that the articles that they read we’ll likely tabloid/social media hype that’s there to provoke a response and incite mass hysteria.

here is the abstract:

a scientific plan is presented that proposes the construction of carbon dioxide (co2) deposition plants in the antarctic for removing co2 gas from earth’s atmosphere. the antarctic continent offers the best environment on earth for co2 deposition at 1 bar of pressure and temperatures closest to that required for terrestrial air co2 ‘‘snow’’ deposition—133 k. this plan consists of several components, including  
1) air chemistry and co2 snow deposition,  
2) the deposition plant and a closed-loop liquid nitrogen refrigeration cycle,  
 3) the mass storage landfill, 
4) power plant requirements,  
5) prevention of dry ice sublimation, and   
6) disposal (or use) of thermal waste.  
calculations demonstrate that this project is worthy of consideration, whereby 446 deposition plants supported by sixteen 1200-mw windfarms can remove 1 billion tons (1012 kg) of carbon (1 gtc) annually (a reduction of 0.5 ppmv), which can be stored in an equivalent ‘‘landfill’’ volume of 2 km x 32km x 3160 m(insulated to prevent dryice sublimation).the individual deposition plant, with a100 m x 3100 m x 3100 m refrigeration chamber, would produce approximately 0.4 m of co2 snow per day. the solid co2 would be excavated into a 380 m x 3380 m x 310 m insulated landfill, which would allow 1yr of storage amounting to 0.002 gtc. demonstrated success of a prototype system in the antarctic would be followed by a complete installation of all 446 plants for co2 snow deposition and storage (amounting to 1 billion tons annually), with wind farms positioned in favorable coastal regions with katabatic wind currents.",0.9092

0,"idea: climate change should not be called climate change yes, the climate changing is caused by increased carbon emission into the atmosphere, but what is the cause of increased carbon emissions?

a lack of renewable recources to sustain our current way of life. climate change has the wrong name, because people only see it for the climate changing, not the fact that as we continue to populate the earth, we consume more and more energy everyday and that is why our climate is changing. 

it is not a crazy world ending phenomenon, but the fact that due to overpopulation and a lack of recources, we can no longer sustain our current way of living without damaging our surrounding habitats. so far our only way to sustain our current way of life is through nuclear power as it is the only minimal waste recources (i say minimal waste because every renewable recources has waste) that can sustain this current way of life. 

i think this isn't understood as much as it should be - lowering carbon emission is an extremely difficult challenge that is caused by our constant consumption of energy. 

so why shouldn't it be called climate change? because people assume too much that it is some overdramatic issue and it can never be understood - that is why there is any sayers. 

instead it should be directly related to energy consumption due to growing demand of supplies as population of the world increases.

in addition to talking about “how climate change is real” of “whether or not climate change is man made...” if we also talk about...

“if climate change doesn’t materialize, great. but if it does, let’s plan for...
- adapting our cities to accommodate climate refugees from countries that’d be impacted first, i.e. [insert “s*hithole” countries”]
- preparing our homes and communities for massive flooding, storms and fires
- revisiting disaster relief funding to reimburse those communities that put money into it, and not communities that don’t give a rat”

in addition to talk of fighting about mitigating the use of fossil fuels, we talk about
- why we’re spending so much on them when renewables are cheap (fact is everyone want to save money).
- or how few communities outside of those in tx, ok, ca benefit from o&g exploration as would from solar, wind etc which would create local jobs

in addition to fighting fossil fuel companies, we talk about “assuming climate change is real”, how oil companies and countries that contributed disproportionately to emissions would compensate those that did not proportionally benefit but were affected by it (say around circa 2030). something along the lines of reparation for slavery.

instead of trying to convince older generations (that disproportionately don’t care about climate change), we shift the conversation to economic and legislative priorities of younger generations circa 2025 by when hopefully boomers would not be a significant voting block (y’know because human ageing)

it feels like the same old arguments over science vs fake science, reality vs denial etc. while helpful, only delivers incremental progress. surely there have to be more tools in the toolkit to move the needle faster.

in civ 6, burning fossil fuels cause the global temperature to rise. slowly at first, but it becomes exponential. as the temperature rises, the ice caps will melt, causing low level land to be reclaimed by the sea and causes more frequent and intense natural disasters like hurricanes and floods. you can also do carbon recapture, but i don't think it helps after the ice caps melt.

5 = climate is changing, humans have some effect
10 = we have until 2030 before ecological collapse (due to cagw)

for the concern scale, should be much easier:

10 = serious depression and despair

take the uk for example. it has a population of 68 million people that emit 6.5 tons of co2 emissions per capita. that’s a total of 442 million tons of co2 per year. at a cost of offset co2 emissions of roughly 5 dollars per ton, the total cost to offset all co2 emissions for uk individuals is only 2.2 billion dollars. compare that to uk gdp of 2.62 trillion dollars, **the offset cost is less than 0.1% of gdp.** 

put in terms of the individual, it **would cost the average brit about 10 cents per day or $2.70 per month to offset their personal carbon emissions**. that not a lot.

from the above math, it seems like a no brainer to offset this. so why isn’t it being done? does the math not hold at scale? is individual co2 emission not really a big deal despite everything we’re being told? is it still harmful if we offset?

slavery will solve our problems, because the whole reason why we mass industrialized in the first place with factories was in order to compensate for the ""great replacement"" of slaves when slavery was abolished and we were left with a serious lack of man power and celestials.

so, what are the opinions out there, and what science do we have to back up those opinions.  i'll go first:

florida is not going to be underwater (outside of some temporary flooding in some coastal cities) within the next 3 decades.  i offer as proof the noaa records of about 100 years of tide gauge data showing that florida has been experiencying under 3 mm per year sea level rise for almost the entire time.  slr rates vary, but have been everywhere from about 2mm per year to a bit over 3 mm per year.  the long term trends are about 2.5 mm per year (about an inch per decade).  unless we see some very severe departure from the long term trend, florida won't be underwater in 2050.",-0.6854

it is a problem that humans don’t have the power to solve unless very impractical and drastic measures are taken. like i understand that the climate is changing but no shit it’ll change. that’s nature. majority of the people in the world don’t have the time, energy or resources to think about saving the earth because they’re thinking about how they’re gonna feed their families and quench their thirst.

i get that humans now have some input in that changing climate but there’s nothing that can be done to “reverse” it.  the population of the earth is going up so fast and you can’t really control that. more people = more environmental stress on earth = more climate change. 

the earths climate has been on a roller coaster. periods that were much hotter than this, periods that were much colder than this. and everything in the middle. and it will continue to change because that’s what nature is. nothing is ever constant or “perfect”.

summers are getting warmer and winters are getting warmer

i hear a load of people say that climate change will effect the next generation and that we will start noticing are impacts on the climate in the next 50 years but to behonest the only reason people are not noticing  it is because they are too arrogant and narrow minded to see that are planet is already fucked up and its already starting to show the serious impacts of are pollution,

people aren’t seeing climate changes effects and i wasn’t either until i properly started to think about the random weather events and weather patterns and temperatures , its weird how we have normalised it to such a point everything appears normal when realistically we will probably be extinct in the next 50 years . 

i just made this rant because i honestly cant bare it anymore how everyone is blatantly ignoring climate change and they don’t see the devastation it could course.

he recently created a clothing brand that is dedicated to help changing the world. i really like the designs he made and i thought it was really creative, this could be a huge movement it many people joined in. they've raised over $10,000 already and they're only growing more everyday.

0,"raising water tables using canals and relocating to land rehabiltion communitys. so here is my question. as far as potable water goes, its really easy to make distilled water from sea water (am i wrong? is this not a thing for some reason?) so immediately that problem easy to solve. now. global warming; we need to stabilize climbing temperatures. if you go look at google maps, you can actually see where there is more green and where there is less. canada is one of the greenest places, basically every that is colder is ok. right away when you look at it, you see that north and south africa is very not green, mid africa is ok.

 what if: we dig canals through africa and other places to start bringing water to the dry areas ( i know, its sea water, keep reading) to start rasing the actual water table to increase soil permeability, even if it doesnt actually help the soil, it would mean you could access the seawater in more areas, bringing the mountain to mohammed as it were, now you can have desalination (or distillation) facilitys every 50 kilometres, allowing for populations to start irrigating and growing forests. **so. now.** the way nature spreads water is by rain. right now the surface area that produces the most rain is the ocean. this would be a fucking huge project, but if we move enough dirt in the right way, we can make canals and rivers and lakes and ponds, increasing the surface area, increasing rainfall in certain areas. once we start getting crops in these areas those areas will start to cool, which will affect weather patterns because we are increasing biomass and reducing ground wind speeds. how many acres of land is not being used because it is unsuitable for habitation? how many places are bursting at the seams for over population? those people in overpopulated areas can be employed and housed in the areas that need (i guess we'll call it) land rehabilitation. the wage they get payed? very low. mostly its room and board,  plus maybe 5 bucks an hour for privileges if they can be payed more, pay them more, you would have to work out the financial bits. i imagine many people would jump at this. if i knew it would work, i certainly would.

if theres anyone else who is also living very poor or whatever you would consider it, however you would phrase it, how do you accept it? do you try and live in the moment and not think about the future? i cant really not think about the future when i know ill still be poor lol. i know this because none of my family can work any harder than we already are. its not physically possibly. we are studying/learning/working. but still cant get better jobs lol. becasue moving to a city would be too expensive right now, and has been for the last 5 years for us. so what, is it gonna take us 50 years to save up to improve our life financially? no. because you cant afford to save money these days lol. at least, we cant. we can save a little bit but car payments/breakdowns usually use up all this money.

for example:  

we talk a lot about personal action (bike to work, less meat, but local, less air travel, no more aerosol disco parties), but maybe all that’s such a small impact that it’s missing the point?  i can’t remember.  

maybe it’s some sort of carbon tax, or some specific industry we need to regulate, or trade tariffs on countries behaving badly.  if it’s something along those lines, then the biggest thing we need to do is vote the right people into power, i suppose.  what specifically is the most import societal change to vote for?  

is it quick-as possible energy source change?  maybe we need to go nuclear right this second.  should we bring that up again, is that our biggest hope?

(advice) i was 16 when i learned about climate change/read the ipcc and knew then that shit was going to hit the fan and affect my future. from that moment, i decided i would dedicate my life to learning about it and doing what i could to fix it. 10 years later i have a masters in climate science and working towards a doctorate. there are options out there for people who want to make a difference but choosing the correct outlet (major in college, courses, etc) is important to get you to the right spot, i didn’t know what to look for or how to get into the field of climate change. academia is not for everyone but it should not be overlooked - multidisciplinary studies are needed between stem and humanities for this crisis. no matter what you want your future career to be, you can in someway incorporate climate change and sustainability. i mention a few tips below but feel free to ask any questions about the field of climate science or how to incorporate it into a future career path. (my guidance counselor in high school had no idea what to tell me and i ended up changing my major twice - i want to be sure advice is available for those who are interested!)

1) just because you are bad at math or chemistry does not mean you would not make an excellent scientist or researcher, no one is perfect and everyone has their strengths/weaknesses

2) if you want to focus on climate change or just want to learn more about it, try to major/minor in earth science/geology - it will give you a good background. even just taking one or more earth sciences classes is really beneficial! if you don’t see climate on the syllabus - ask your teacher or professor to address it in class. public schooling doesn’t do the best job of talking about the intersections of chem, bio, physics but geology/earth science does. also talk to professors/teachers about what your interests are, they should be able to help you find a direction better than a guidance counselor

3) incorporate your anxieties of climate change into your work. incorporate the idea of being sustainable into everyday life. class project/paper/presentation? incorporate climate change. sometimes you have to be creative with how things are interwoven but honestly it will affect most everything - economics, health, ecosystems, food + water supplies, real estate, politics, social sciences, etc. addressing it from every angle will help us to be more prepared. also it could give you leverage when applying for jobs etc that you have a multidisciplinary outlook.

4) if you are interested in climate science or research, look online for universities with research programs based on climate change that are in your interest. reach out to professors to see if they need undergraduate helpers - i have seen these opportunities turn into masters many times.

0,"climate change vs environmentalism so, in order to combat climate change, we need to use clean sources of energy. currently, climate change activists are pushing solar and wind energy. because both are unreliable(they both rely on the right weather), they require a system to store the energy. and that brings us to our problem.

there are 2 type of storage for electricity: capacitors and batteries. unlike batteries, capacitors “charge” virtually instantly, but are too large and expensive to be a viable solution. i’m not sure of the environmental impact, but cost of such a system means we will never find out. 

climate activists seem to have settled on batteries. batteries are terrible and don’t last too long. every battery would need to be replaced every 5-10 years. a lot of energy is lost in the charging process. the materials needed to make the batteries are toxic. the environment is destroyed in the procurement, processing, and disposal. as if the solar panels that need to be replaced every 15-25 years doesn’t generate enough toxic waste. 

what’s the point in stopping climate change if we’re just going to destroy the environment process?

from what i understand the only energy source that can provide clean energy and won’t require us to destroy the environment with batteries is nuclear energy. and no one is going to go for nuclear energy... chernobyl and fukushima  are the first thing that comes to anyone’s mind. and nuclear waste processing is a notoriously dirty business if half of what john oliver said was true. and most of the active facilities in the us are being closed because their in such severe disrepair.

0,"climate change is unimportant, is it? i live in nsw australia. i feel every day like i'm living in an apocalypse film.  i live in nsw, australia. we are on fire, and have been for weeks.

today has been covered in smoke cloud. you can see it, and it wasn't just an early morning thing. it looks like 70s celluloid film of a wartime movie: hazy burnt orange, making any green look khaki. i look out at the late afternoon sun, and it's red. not nice autumn orange, though we have just entered summer, it's *red* in a field of haze. it has been for days. the afternoon sunshine is bright orange on those days where the smoke haze isn't too thick for the sun to get through.

today was 39 degrees celsius. the winds have picked up. the firefighters have been at it for over a month. over two million hectares of forest and bush has been burnt - there isn't much green left on our map. huge portions of it are now soot black. you look at where the fires are, and the markers of them on the map overlap like you're looking at a field of wildflowers in blue, yellow, and red. people have lost their lives. people have lost their homes. the devastation of wildlife is huge.

sydney has just been put on a hosepipe ban. i watered my plants with reserve water from the shower. my one cat has asthma. i've been making sure to close us in tightly on smoke days and give her her preventer puffer every day. otherwise she has an attack when she gets up to do anything at all. it's week three of this.

we are in drought. again. and it looks worse this time. there are parts of nsw where the dams are empty. truly empty. dust fields that are massive, nothing able to grow in these conditions.

the sirens are heard from my house going by time and time again - loud and multiple as i try to get to sleep. people who have it worse than my cat and can't breathe. i drive home and see firetrucks up by people's houses. i pull aside for ambulances racing to help people who rely on clean air a bit more than the rest of us do.

it's two weeks to christmas, and we look outside to see something apocalyptic rising with the sun. places i've been - places i know well - sit facing fires approaching them from all sides. ""i wish you all the luck in the world"" is what i can say to those i know facing it, and what i get back is ""we will stand and defend our home.""

these aren't small fires that burn out in days. these are firegrounds larger than sydney itself that have been burning for weeks. the hot air rises from them, along with the ash, and it meets the damp winds off the ocean. the result is a thunderstorm.

you'd think rain would put these fires out. it does not. the ground and combustibles on it is so dry a deluge does little to nothing. the fires keep raging, even as water, unable to be absorbed by a ground too parched to take it, floods away from them. we get floods on top of fires. sooty water running away from a blaze that won't stop blazing.

these thunderstorms are unlike any i have ever seen before. people say thunderstorms bring a false twilight. this is a very late twilight - nautical twilight, perhaps. early afternoon becomes just before full dark with a rapidity that is both blustering and daunting. and it's a while yet before the rain falls, though you can hear the thunderclaps and see the lightning these ash-ridden clouds create well before you know the loud pattering of raindrops and hailstones. you just hope one of these lightning strikes doesn't happen nearby.

because these thunderstorms start new fires. they put nothing out, while, at the same time, bring more fire; more destruction.

i've sat on tenterhooks, waiting to hear whether i'm needed to help evacuate people. i've watched places i know well go up in smoke. i've waded through that smoke haze, feeling like i have a constant burgeoning cold, trying to carry on with daily life when it feels like the place i live, where my loved ones live, is to be short lived.

and then there are the arsonists. i'm at a point where i'd wish the harshest of punishments on anyone who, in whatever fit of stupidity they were suffering, did the malicious act of lighting another of these damned fires. more water that we don't have spent on fighting them. planes and helicopters flying overhead trying to stop the intractable and progressive wall of huge orange flames before more people, more homes, and more wildlife are destroyed. all because of some absolute wanker who thought it'd be ""funny"" or ""cool"".

outside my window is sepia tones. it isn't usually. usually it's blue, and an australian green; and the grey of tarmac and the brown of bricks. it seems all is bathed in that burnt orange; we're all feeling it, some more than others.

i look at wollemi national park on wikipedia. only home to a species of tree they thought was extinct on the mainland. home to aboriginal heritage sites. home to a great many things. an amazing space of wilderness, it tells you, so worthy of preserving. not a word about the fact that it is black.

never before in my life have i been so tempted to edit a wikipedia article as i was just to add the salient point: ""*it's on fire""*. there's little of it left. i tried to edit it. i had the sources i was going to cite with me. i don't understand internet code well enough to do that without my contribution accidentally wiping out, as the fires are doing, the words that that article contains about how worth preserving the national park is.

""climate change?"" they say. ""what climate change?""

i looked at cape town, south africa and thought, ""thank the fates we have it okay here!""

now i look outside and wonder how long it's all going to last. it's hard not to be fatalistic when you're living in a place that's giving you every bloody indication you, your species, and all you care for is inhospitable here. that all the fucking around we've been doing has just been begging for this to happen.",0.9642

now, despite my lifestyle, i am a very progressive person. being bisexual, an effeminate male, and jewish, i believe in social liberalism and in the rights of women and minorities. i also disagree with regime change wars, and our nation's broken healthcare and student debt systems.

but another issue many progressives believe in is combating climate change. and as much as i believe in the existence and threat of climate change, it just fails to grab my interest. don't get me wrong, i deeply appreciate and am inspired by the works of people like jay inslee and greta thunberg, but i myself don't feel the need to discuss climate change myself as it simply fails to fascinate me like lgbtqia+ rights or medicare for all does.

however, that's not what this post is mainly about. i know that one of the best ways to prevent climate change is to find an enviormentally friendly alternative to harmful chemicals that enter the air such as co2. but what worries me is that those alternatives won't be as good at fueling my decadent lifestyle as the current fuels are.

there’s a reason why “per capita is mentioned when talking about america's emissions, because of the different measurements of co2.  the reason why co2 outputs can vary from source to source is because there are different metrics for measuring co2. absolute co2 emissions would skew results towards big countries. relative co2 emissions would favor underdeveloped and smaller countries while disregarding factors such as deforestation and environmental protection. low co2 emissions would also favor countries with unique circumstances such as norway which has a low population, is big on hydropower and is a huge exporter of oil and gas. 

reducing something implies that actions were intentionally taken rather than the u.s. having increasing efficiency and slower growth of co2 emissions.

another issue with the way this topic is discussed is as if chemistry is under “winner takes all” implication. the largest source of a chemical does not have all the effects, so every other country seeking to reduce their emissions are still contributing to minimize the consequences, even if china and the us do nothing (even though both countries are and should be).",0.4094
0,"a simplistic counter for scientifically-challenged skeptics i was recently having an online debate with a former colleague of mine. like me, he's an electrical engineer. so he's intelligent to a degree, reasonably articulate and ostensibly capable of rationale, critical thought. but unlike me he's a right-wing, conservative, christian, conspiracy-theory-harbouring low-key homophobe. 

he's incredibly frustrating in his dogged adherence to whacky and unscientific ideas, despite being a man of practical science in his chosen profession as an engineer. he shits me to tears with some of the balmy stuff he says and believes. i really only keep him around for the unique and strange discussions that often arise, as i think it's healthy to engage with those having serious contrary views. it helps one to understand the other side and to formulate one's own thoughts coherently - as well as providing a measure of comfort in the knowledge that despite the challenges life throws at us, at least we didn't get unduly whacked too heavily at birth by the batshit crazy stick.
 
he's a climate change denier and strong proponent of continued fossil fuel consumption. when it comes to climate science, one of the mainstays of his position is an assertion that it's arrogant and ridiculous of mankind to think that our actions could somehow have a meaningful effect on the wondrous creation of god that is planet earth. despite the bountiful supply of ammunition for an atheist and man of science like me, i came up with what i consider to be a nice simplistic counter. it goes like this.

fossil fuels are basically a massive carbon store that was naturally sequestered by the planet over hundreds of millions of years. in the space of a mere couple of centuries, humans have removed vast quantities of that carbon from storage and converted it back to co2. how could any rational person possibly believe that this wouldn't have a significant effect on the stability of various planetary equilibriums?",0.9028

however, we also know that there have been cyclical ice ages in the past and in such times the planet gets about 3 km deep ice sheets covering a huge chunk of north america, north europe etc. there were also times when the ice went pretty much all the way up to the equator. when it is this cold, life doesn't do great on planet earth. i would hate to live during an ice age. i think it is no coincidence civilization started to develop when the last ice age ended.

we also know that there have been times, between ice ages, when it was much hotter than it is now. mammals tend to do quite well when it is hotter and so do plants. 

my question is - assuming we get to a point where we are better at influencing the climate and we can actually control it, what should we do? do we keep it at a steady temperature, forever, say the current one? should we interfere if an ice age is coming and we can prevent it? should we make it hotter if it means we can free up more habitable space than we lose and we needed such space?",0.5038

solutions to suck carbon out of the sky would be very expensive... and i was thinking, what about floating machines which float around in the ocean, so many that they cover the size of texas. sucking carbon and dropping carbon nuggets to the ocean floor, nuggets which are non-reactive and just stay as nuggets, storing the co2 there.

when the amazon rainforest was burning i remember seeing figures of around 2 million tonnes co2e per year sequestration rate (quick google search seem to confirm that). if that’s the case, don’t we need thousands of amazon rainforests to satisfy the world’s high carbon lifestyle even when taking into account savings from home insulation and switching to green energy?

i'm aware that a lot of people will be against the idea of being limited. hell, i wouldn't be surprised if a whole nation votes against it. but if people truly want to decrease the amount of co2 emission they produce in a day, i think rules such as taking away electricity, or not being able to drive your car after midnight could save the future of our children.",0.6116

it could draw influences from scientific predictions. it could be set during, after or before oil and water wars. coastal cities could be dangerous abandoned places that are partially submerged. the cast of characters would have to endure extreme weather patterns, crazy storms, hailstones big enough to kill etc.

another potential angle could be rich remnants of society living in walled-in communities on higher ground, the problems that they'd face not only keeping the rabble out, but dealing with their own younger generations wanting to let people in (or leave themselves) and help as many people as possible, but the older generation won't let them. an alternative angle could be that the generations born inside the walls are simply lied to, told that the world is doing just fine, nobody needs any help and those resources are ours and finite. but obviously, people escape and find out the truth.

i would say, starting immediately, recycling is mandatory, and we need classes and videos showing us and teaching us what can and cannot be recycled, and how to prep things we will recycle. 

discontinue use of fossil fuels, there are clean energy fuel alternatives in the works, and soon there will be solar powered cars that charge themselves while you drive: imagine never having to get gas again? i'm waiting for flying cars, but i don't have information on them.

p,lastics have to go, we're already bringing our own bags to grocery stores, we have so many products stored in plastic, it's hard to imagine living without it, but it's come to a point, if we want to live, we have to live without it. there are other materials like glass or ceramic, even cardboard, that would suffice.

these are just a few ideas that would help, i'm trying to get answers and find solutions, i can't stand that this is happening, and i will do everything i can and more to restore the earth, without the earth, none of us would exist.

on an added note, i think they should ban guns and any type of firearms in the u.s., no one may own or purchase a gun, they will be assigned strictly to law enforcement and the military. i even have red flags about law enforcement having guns, there have been to many tragic incidents lately of the police shooting innocent people. and i know the nra would disapprove my suggestion, i would like to talk with them about their policies, since i know nothing about them, and ask them if their children feel safe going to school?

if we make the tasks it takes to reverse climate change trendy, people will catch on, begin a new habit -intentionally, good healthy habits are the coolest things to do, they're at the top of all billboard charts, the headlines on every newspaper, in fact we need to start a global craze of good habits, and have fun cleaning up the earth, we can restore it to a livable state, and know that we all made a difference.",0.98

this isn’t to say i know i’m right, i have my opinions and need to take in as much information as i can to make an informed one. i just want to put the idea in to the ether, that we should all look to do the same and, at the same time, not try to smear somebody who questions or tries to disprove, as that is the basis of science.",0.8661

0,"""climate change"" is not a good description i remember when we used to call it ""global warming"", which seems to have fallen out of favor, i think because the average person couldn't seem to understand that a rise in the average global temperature didn't necessarily mean they wouldn't have to shovel snow in the winter. and in fact, some places could get colder even as the average temperature is rising. so i understand that more people can relate to ""climate change"".

but it isn't just the climate that is changing. the melting of glaciers has an impact on climate, but it also can effect sea levels, ocean chemistry, ocean currents, and even the level of the land under a glacier will rise as the weight of the glacier is removed. ocean acidification due to co2 can drastically disrupt ocean ecosystems. changes in climate on land also can have many effects on geological and biological systems that may impact humans far more than the actual changes in climate.

so i would suggest that a more appropriate term is ""planetary disruption"". i don't really expect it to be adopted, if for no other reason because changing terminology just triggers more skeptics. but planetary disruption is what is actually happening, and probably in more ways than we yet understand. the vagueness in the term ""disruption"" is intentional, exactly because i don't think we know how all these changes will interact. i think we need people who are trained across disciplines of ecology, climatology, and geology, including the necessary  background in physics, chemistry, and biology. and we need funding and international cooperation for these people to study what is happening across the globe, try to develop predictive models, and perhaps even develop ways to avoid some of the disruption.

i believe that ultimately some kind of geoengineering will be required to save our civilization, if not our species. there have already been some proposals and experiments. but i believe we are still well short of the scientific understanding that will be needed for anything more than a ""hail mary"" attempt, which could even make things worse. and although economic and political globalism have taken some lumps recently, there needs to be global acceptance of the immediate need to improve our scientific understanding of planetary disruption, and any attempts at geoengineering need to be regulated by an international organization, based on the best scientific knowledge available.",0.3237

cause they’re choking on my air

""flooding, dryness, heat or cold waves: today everything is supposed to be a sign of the apocalypse - this was not always the case. whenever the sun shines for a few days in a row and it gets warmer than 30 degrees or longer rains fall and the water levels of the rivers rise, some media and ""experts"" claim that climate change is now hitting with full force. a look at history shows that there have always been weather capers and that people knew how to deal with them as well as with their consequences, without immediately developing hysterical end-of-the-world fantasies. this is also the case in the saxon capital dresden.

persistently high temperatures and the resulting droughts plagued the people here as early as 1473, 1504, 1563, 1590, 1616, 1642, 1790 (at that time, this even led to the kursachsen peasant uprising), 1842, 1874, 1893, 1904, 1911, 1921, 1934, 1935 and 1954. the chronicle of the city council for 1473 reported: ""summer was so hot and dry that drinking water was only available for money"". and in 1590 it was said: ""because of great drought the mills stopped. the elbe was almost dried up."" the latter also happened in 1954, when the level of the river fell below ten centimetres and once again the legendary ""starvation stones"" appeared on the ground.

if it wasn't too hot and too dry or too wet, severe frost became a problem. this occurred in particular in the years 1416, 1466, 1524, 1597, 1612, 1664 and 1673 to 1679, whereby the cold waves in the 17th century were effects of the so-called ""little ice age"". now the mills failed instead of due to lack of water due to icing, and in the woods ""many hundreds of deer ... fell dead"". in addition to hunger, there was also a shortage of wine, because the frost already set in in late summer and the grapes spoiled.

the biggest weather-related scourge of the population in dresden, which lies directly on the elbe, was of course the constantly recurring, devastating floods, during which the level of the river rose over seven metres, which would today lead to the declaration of the highest possible alarm level.

between the years 1200 and 2013 there must have been around 35 such extreme flood events. this means that the alleged ""millennium floods"" of 2002 (elbe gauge at the augustus bridge next to the residenz castle: 9.40 metres) and 2013 (gauge: 8.76 metres) were by no means one-off events and thus indications of the alleged climate change in the present. water levels were similarly high in 1845 (8.77 metres), 1501 and 1784 (8.57 metres each), 1655 (8.38 metres), 1862 and 1799 (8.24 metres each).

there are no concrete measurements from the time before, which is why it is quite possible that the river swelled even more dramatically in the past. for example, during the legendary ""magdalene flood"" of july 1342, which afflicted the whole of central europe, or in the terrible flood years 1272, 1275, 1318, 1400, 1430 and 1432. taking into account the damage mentioned in old documents, water levels of more than ten metres are conceivable.""",-0.9733

the density of the rising gas may not support the weight of the animal, causing it to go into freefall until it reaches the bottom of the bubble. if the bubble is large, the freefall may be of a substantial height, meaning that the force of impact, as the animal lands on the water at the base of the bubble, may be significant. this may result in the animal being killed, or being knocked unconscious and subsequently drowning.

obviously all of these have upfront co2 embedded in their production.

i was talking to my mom on the way back from a gig about how i wanted to find a college that had a visible commitment school wide to sustainability. she was talking about yale and i said i had no interest in the school. she said that they were a research school so they probably had a lot of environmental research about taking plastic out of the oceans and something else i forgot. i said research is important and it's great that they're doing that but i also want to see that they are applying sustainability to the way they live at the school. i'm not going to sit around and wait for somebody else to fix the climate crisis, and i'm certainly not going to wait until i'm out of college to do something. i mentioned how clark university and i think bu as well had four different bins: landfill, papers/cardboard, cans, and compost. i was really happy to see that because i knew if they had four different labels for things, they wouldn't just mix the recycling in with the garbage like they do at my school, where it all ends up in the landfill. she said i shouldn't say that one school is better than another just because it has ""four recycling bins"", in her words. this got me upset because she completely jumped to conclusions on what i had just said. i wasn't saying that those schools were better for that reason; i didn't even use the word ""better"". i meant that that was just one out of several examples of those schools having a visible, tangible commitment to sustainability. i don't know how much more i can emphasize that this is the biggest crisis of our time and we need to be doing something. she already thinks i'm crazy for being scared of not having a future. she told me to just ""live my life to the fullest"". why can't we live to the fullest and live sustainably at the same time? i'd be much happier than i am now if my mom even so much as acknowledged the fact that we have a very large individual impact. i think of her mentality on our impact as that meme of the person pouring a tiny bucket of water on a huge fire. she thinks composting and reducing/refusing plastic don't matter, when they can really be greatly beneficial, especially if large amounts of people take part in it. to clarify i can't drive yet and i don't have a job so i feel very limited in what i can do, which is extremely frustrating because i feel so alone in this. i know all of you care but i wish my family did too. i'm hopefully going to a local environmental organization meeting on the 27th and i will see if they can tell me how to persuade people to acknowledge the extent of the individual impact that we have. if you read this far thanks, it means a lot.",0.9703

do an experiment should you not believe me.

take a glass of water. fill it almost all the way up. now, put some ice cubes in the glass to where the water level reaches the exact top of the glass.

you’ll notice that the ice cubes are floating on the top of the water, with approximately a 90:10 split, with 90% of area of the ice cubes under the water line and about 10% of the ice cube over the water line.

now, this represents our oceans and the glacier ice that democrats are claiming that when melted will raise the ocean levels.

if melting glacier ice will raise the level of the oceans, then when the ice melts in the glass, you’d expect the water in the glass to begin to spill out and overflow the glass. so, let the floating ice cubes melt and watch what happens. if the democrats are correct, the water will overflow. if the democrats are wrong, the ice will simply melt, and the water level will remain the same.

so, which one happens?

as i said - 90% of the ice is already below the water line – and when ice melts, it takes up a lower volume than when it’s frozen…by about 10% - keeping the level of the water in the glass, the exact same.

melting sea ice, glacier ice, melting icebergs, and the entire melting of the arctic will not raise the level of the oceans. (because the arctic has no continent, it's just floating frozen ice. only if antarctica was to fully melt would any effect be able to be measured on the ocean levels. however, the average annual temperature range in antarctica is 14 degrees f to -76 degrees f. the earth would have to raise it’s global temperature 108 degrees to fully melt antarctica…

now, climate alarmists claim that all of ice were to melt, global sea level would rise approximately 70 meters (approximately 230 feet), flooding every coastal city on the planet. but to make that happen, we need a global temperature increase of 108 degrees to ensure antarctica doesn’t re-freeze. no one ever talks about evaporation, and the ideas that, again, basic science takes into effect with rain, wind, and how the earth spreads the water about… the pseudo-science behind the alarmists and the idea that our coastal cities will disappear is nutz.",-0.5994

there are the obvious changes such as changes in diet, changing things in the house etc., but what could i do with let's say €1000 or €10000 to help curb climate change? 
i'm looking for something that can be done more than once. so not just switching a car, but something more scalable.

0,"speaking only for where i live (ontario canada) we need to go back to selling pop/soda/beverages in glass bottles. decades ago we were only able to buy coca-cola (to pick on them because they're the biggest beverage company but all beverages sold are part of the same situation) in glass bottles. we paid a deposit and that ensured we returned the bottles.

this meant no plastic was used, and no oil was refined into plastic, so no co2 was used. the bottles were returned for re-use by the same guy delivering the new pop to the store. 


the system worked very well. 


then they started selling pop in plastic bottles that we threw out each time. 


we became environmentally conscious and cities, using taxpayer money, had to start recycling programs to stop that plastic from entering the landfill sites.  


we all know many plastic bottles aren't recycled, they are discarded in the garbage or elsewhere and end up in landfill sites or in lakes and rivers. 

in essence we have subsidized coca-cola and all other beverage/bottlers with taxpayer money so they can sell the product at higher profit margins.

going back to a glass bottle system with a robust and required deposit system would be beneficial for the environment and also save cities millions on recycling costs. 

this is a no-brainer and coca-cola et al should be doing this voluntarily. 

yes glass bottles break, yes they end up in landfill and in water - but glass is 100% benign if discarded at least from a pollution standpoint (its melted and reconstituted sand afterall) . plastic is toxic if discarded.


the other counterpoint people bring up is the added diesel needed to transport the empties back to the plant.  this is minimal. it would be likely less than 1% added diesel costs.

0,"the best thing you can do to stop climate change you know which country causes the most ghg emissions? yup, china. and why do they. well one reason is that they have 1.4 billion people and a lot of people means a lot of emissions.

but it's also because they manufacture a shit ton of goods, cheap goods, that we buy every day. almost everything is made in china now because their labor costs and materials are so cheap.

and all those goods are manufactured in places that are powered by coal. and coal is one of the worst ways to produce power.

so...

if you stop buying stuff made in china, china uses less power to manufacture the millions of tons of goods that we consume and ships, trains and trucks that transport those goods dont have to burn carbon based fuel to bring it to your local walmart.

when you buy something, check where it was made. if it says, ""made in china"" put it back on the shelf. buy local.",-0.9153

0,"carbon neutrality - emissions or atmosphere? hi, i realized i was confused about a subtlety regarding being ""carbon neutral"".

does carbon neutral mean net zero co2 \*added to the atmosphere\*?  or does it mean net zero co2 \*emitted\*, period? because the latter is a much higher standard. (since only about 45% of co2 emissions stay in the atmosphere.)

before the industrial revolution, the planet's co2 level was relatively stable for around 10,000 years. but in that time, humans were definitely emitting co2 from various levels of industry. so they were carbon neutral while also emitting co2.

i'd like to know more about that 45% number, too. does that percentage correlate with our emission level? like, if we were emitting 10 gigatons of co2 per year rather than 37, would that percentage be lower, like 10%? and is there a level of co2 emissions where the planet will just absorb all of it, beyond the level we were at prior to the industrial revolution?  like, maybe we get the first five gigatons for free or something?",0.9664
0,"a few negatives about the ongoing protests i was recently told by my friend about the massive opposition against nuclear power and unwavering support to solar power and wind energy in the ongoing climate change protests. 


i also read about the recurring theme of paying reparations to developing countries for the environmental effects of colonialism.

i am in strong support of renewable energy but there are concrete reasons as to why it cannot solve our energy needs in a practical manner. 

1. solar power is highly inefficient as most of you must have read about it. my country has been advocating for solar power for many years now and has done a lot in that sphere. but the problem is that it is simply not feasible at the moment. we should not just take a radical step by shifting to solar power. 

° instead, we should invest in its development (what bill gates and many others are doing) to improve the efficiency so that it covers less area, costs less and gives enough energy to atleast sustain a household (a few panels per house)

2. wind energy is heavily dependent on the general wind conditions of a place. it is extremely expensive given the output and cannot work everywhere. unless our innovators come up with a design which is not only cost effective but also easier to install and less dependent on strong wind currents, it cannot solve our problems. thus, we need to research more.

3. hydroelectric energy has great potential at the cost of upsetting the local ecosystem and disturbing the natural course of water bodies. there was a company in our country which tried to harness energy by building turbines on waterfalls. that sounded like a brilliant idea although i did not hear about them afterwards.

4. paying reparations is never the answer. you're never gonna know where the money will go to after it passes over to the governments of the developing nations. this is not a matter of discriminatory labelling but simply a fact about human nature. coming from a developing country myself, i can assure you that corruption here is rampant.

5. my country has almost 25% of the total thorium reserves. so does australia. that's (a bit less than) half of all known thorium that occurs on our planet. anyone who's a nuclear physics professor/student would be able to tell you in detail about molten salt reactors. thorium when used as a fuel is much safer, more abundant in nature, and produces less nuclear waste. there are downsides the biggest of which are the cost at the beginning since there is a general hysteria due to another reason which is easy proliferation. during the irradiation stage of thorium, u-233 is produced providing fuel for nuclear weaponry.

° but i believe that with global scrutiny and cooperation, this can be solved. the opposition against nuclear power is heavily misguided. the disasters (fukushima and chernobyl) occured due to outdated structural features. both the reactors were more than 50 years old. to combat this, there must be routine inspections now that we know the consequences. banning nuclear energy is not an answer. we are simply ignoring a vast reserve of clean energy by giving in to panic and mass opinion which is usually not based on facts but on the emotional aspects.

there have been more—much more—deaths and pollution due to coal power plants. we need to get together on this. 

to be honest, climate change is not the top priority of the general public in the developing nations. very few can afford solar panels let alone wind turbines.

— {i'm from india and while i'm writing this, my city has almost submerged (5 ft water at many places) due to intense rains. such a thing has never occured in my lifetime. we are trapped in our homes. our potable water will run out by the end of tomorrow. if the water doesn't recede by some miracle, the situation will get dire. i was very concerned about it and the governmental failure in addressing it. i thought i would give my 2 cents here. i would like to have your opinions on this.}",0.9862

i know that in the last 6 years the whales in my area have gone from many to few. i know that krill live under the polar ice for part of their cycle and as the ice leaves there is no longer any food for the whales.
i am seeing natural cycles reversing irreversibly. global warming, polar ice melts, light absorbed rather than reflected by ice, area gets hotter, more ice melts. no food for whales, whales disappear and never come back. it's  irreversible. global warming, insects decreasing by 60 % around the world, decrease pollinators, decrease plants, decrease insects etc.
real climate scientists could tell us many cycles like this reversing irreversibly , if they are having a good day with their depression.
yes, but there are things we can do to reduce greenhouse gases. really? will you give up your car or cars if they are irreplaceable in your work? will you cancel an airplane trip to see a deceased relative or child being married, or visit a place you've yearned for all your life? will you ignore cheaper goods because their creation causes greenhouse gases. what exactly are you willing to give up? see what i mean?
