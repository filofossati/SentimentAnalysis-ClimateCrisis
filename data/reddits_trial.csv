0,Vegetarian / Belief,"   
I think when it comes to “Believe” as religion and foundation that direct our livelihood, the message/teaching is always about compassion and wisdom. Wisdom means right/wrong, OR good/better. Wisdom also include ""gratitude"". Gratitude, in my opinion means to not being greedy. It’s learning about control, self control, so we don’t destroy ourselves and/or others.  


The concept of ""karma"" which widely use in our society is also the main topic of Buddhist, and I think the concept of ""karma"" is very similar to our concept of ""sin"".  Vegetarian and Buddhism is closely tied together, and by using the concept of ""karma"" or ""sin"", maybe there's logical explaination to why Buddha promotes /reccomend vegetarianism.  


Being sinful means we have negative karma based on our wrongdoing. Based on this concept, when human eats/consumes meat, we are sinned. Then there’s concept of reincarnation. If human eat chicken, the following life, that human will become chicken. Based on this logic, there’s possibility of transforming the body in the next or next next lifetime; human realm to animal realm or vice versa. To be borned sinned, however, present not only in Buddhism, but also in Christianity.  


The thing is, again, just my opinion, reincarnation isn’t the root teaching of any religion, certainly not Buddhism. The root and main idea is always about wisdom and compassion. The consumption of meat/fish is certainly acceptable in moderation, as long as it doesn’t hurt the one who consume.  The change in the way we consume and produce meat in 20th century deliminate the idea of ""being grateful"" and thankful for the nurturing mother earth/animal/ or maybe the whole cosmos. Human takes thing for granted and our wisdom decline.  When it becomes habitual, we forget the gratitude and we lose our compassionate nature. We think it is just the way it is, and that might insult other lives in the universe. This especially true for human. We call ourselves “like no other animal” because of our ability to create and to control. Eating is not simply to live and get full. Balance diet is health. Food is medicine, and to eat is to cure the sickness of hunger while too much eating is the cause of sickness.  Our taste and tongue is trainable and adaptable. Craving eating meat is merely the result of habitual tendency. Can we control this eating part of us? Can we control our greed for consuming meat mindlessly? Maybe we'll regain our self control &amp; balance, and hopefully help to refrain us from being power/materialistically greedy, which cause war and damage to the earth &amp; environment.",sustainability,1646299328

2,Happy Unthankful Thanksgiving - Celebrating Unsustainable Thursday - The Real Big Lie,"Thanksgiving is a very strange US Holiday.  Americans celebrate the day by breaking bread with family - ignoring  or ignorant of the massacre of the Native Americans that were rounded up and sequestered in unsuitable land and living conditions that persist to this day.  And this is tied to the big lie that Columbus somehow made it to America first (which he didn't) and 'discovered' the US which happened to have thousands living well, happily and sustainably.  And the so-called hero cowboys that were basically dumb-ass rednecks (likely modern day Trumpers) killed every Native American that they could find that did not conform to European traditions.  And lastly, we killed countless numbers of buffalo which had sustained the native residents for hundreds of years before being discovered.  And in true American style we gloss over these hard truths and instead rationalize this Holiday as giving thanks to those we care about.  And of course, to add insult to injury, the day after Thanksgiving is the busiest shopping day of the year.  So we might think of Thanksgiving as the Anti-Earth Day or Unsustainable Thursday.  Wow - I just went off on a big tangent!  Happy Thanksgiving  (sorry)...gulp",sustainability,1637795081

7,"""Electric cars will still create CO2 emissions"" is a fallacy","I've been discussing this a lot recently. Many people are of the opinion that electric cars still result in emissions, just elsewhere - instead of CO2 coming from the tailpipe of your car, it comes from a fossil fuel power plant.

While this is largely true *for now*, it is not necessarily true forever. As we move into the future, there's the possibility that we transition to fully renewable, zero-emission power generation. At that point, electric cars will actually have no correlated CO2 emissions. There are lots of caveats i could get into about this, but for the sake of clarity I wont.

The argument that electric cars result in comparable emissions to internal combustion engines (ICE) is a fallacy because it relies on the assumption that our power generation infrastructure will stay the same forever. There is no way an ICE will *ever* be zero emissions, but there is a decent chance that in the future, electric cars will be zero emissions.

8,What should the price of carbon be?,"So, I’m all for Team Carbon Pricing. I believe the climate crisis is basically a market failure caused by the negative externalities of carbon emissions (climate forcing as well as smog and other health effects) not being appropriately included in the price of coal, oil, etc. If we could make the price of a barrel of oil reflect the true costs, the market would take care of decarbonizing in the most efficient way possible. There are various ways to do this (carbon tax, cap and trade), but they accomplish the same basic task.

I also understand that carbon isn’t priced correctly due to lack of political will. From oil lobbying,  to popular opposition such as the Yellow Vest protests, to lack of international consensus— there are massive barriers to appropriate carbon pricing.

If we look past the practical issues though, there is another question that I don’t know the answer to. What is the appropriate price for carbon? There must be economists who have looked into this and developed an estimate for what a barrel of oil should cost to account for the current and future environmental impacts.

I can't see GMOs being bad for the environment, they tend to have better yields and are genetically modified to resist pests, so there's less reliance on pesticides. But organic is a term also associated with less pesticide use and less fertilizers in general, and both pesticides and fertilizers have negative impacts such as creating deadzones and contributing to climate change. The article argues that although this is true, in many cases it also opens up more land for carbon sequestering, as organic has a larger land footprint than conventional farming. So I'm interested to hear what your informed opinions on it are.",sustainability,1632531312
10,Why carbon offsets may be a bad thing,"I saw a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/pkur8l/offsetting_your_carbon_footprint_for_or_against/) asking what people on this sub thought about carbon offsets, and was surprised not to see the point I’m going to make:

We have already emitted 660 billion tons of carbon (equivalent to 2420 billion tons of CO2). In order to mitigate climate change, in addition to lowering and eventually ceasing all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, we must suck up carbon from the atmosphere. 

There are nature-based ways to do so: ecosystem restoration, and in particular reforestation. Forests can only store a finite amount of carbon: after a few decades to a century, forests reach an equilibrium and as much carbon is emitted by decomposing vegetation as is sucked in by growing trees.

Moreover, the surface on which we can reforest (or even afforest) is limited. Even when being [over-optimistic](https://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aay7976), reforestation [could only offset one-third](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76) of our historical emissions. In summary, we have 150 years’ worth of emissions to offset, and insufficient means to do so. 

Now how do carbon offsetting fits into all this? In my opinion, it gives social license to further emit GHG. It basically makes something that is slowly getting unacceptable, fully acceptable again. But no harm is done since all the GHG emitted in my name are offset right? Well, for the reasons I outlined above, this is not true. Each gram of carbon we allow ourselves to emit today under the pretext that it will be offset means that a gram emitted yesterday will not be sequestered and will continue to warm the planet, with known consequences.

For emissions that we can’t avoid, I imagine offsetting may be worth it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is without mentioning several other issues with carbon offset, some of which were in the comments of the post I mentionned :

1) Emissions occur instantaneously, whereas trees and soils take several years and up to decades to store the same amount of carbon. As we’re already experiencing increased frequency and/or intensity of extreme weather events, it is unclear if we can afford to add additional carbon in the atmosphere, even if it’s for “only” a few years or decades.

2) I think sometimes mono-tree fields are planted as carbon offsets. Obviously, the benefits in terms of biodiversity, but also in terms of carbon storage and other ecosystem services of monocrops are much lower compared to an actual forest. Another point if that coniferous trees are often planted because they grow quickly. But they also have super low albedo. At some latitudes, they may thus warm more the planet through lower albedo than they cool it through reduced greenhouse effect.

3) I think sometimes trees are not properly taken care of after being planted (if they are even planted), so won’t ever fulfil their role as carbon offsets.

4) Carbon offsets fully shift the responsibility from the industry and the companies to individuals. Most often, the responsibility is shared.",sustainability,1631380823
11,"ESG &amp; Impact Investing-Death March in Wrong Direction, but slower","I am increasingly see more people being openly critical and not pursuing a politically correct response to the powers that be around slow incremental improvement of societal and environmental challenges. It seems that many are following Howard Beale’s yawp from 1976 Sidney Lumet’s Movie Network.Sidney Lumet, 1976 - “[I'm Mad As Hell and I'm Not Gonna Take This Anymore!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRuS3dxKK9U)”. 

When TBLi started 25 years ago to change the financial system so it worked for multiple stakeholders, we had tremendous pushback from Asset owners, managers, service providers, rating agencies, etc. Many think it was smooth sailing in Europe. The opposite is true. I remember being asked to speak to Dutch insurance industry when TBLi started about climate risk. I said “The Netherlands is below sea level. Sea Level are going to rise, I would be concerned.” The answer I got from the audience showed how low level of awareness existed. “It not a problem for us if sea level rises. We don’t cover salt water damage.” I told that insurance executive “that is true but you give mortgages. If 200.000 homes are under water, you have a big financial disaster”. We have come a long way. Unfortunately the money flows and definition has given a false sense of success. I think we have failed miserably. We need Investing 2.0 that is far more regenerative in nature.

Based upon the money flows, one would say it has been a resounding success. “ESG assets may hit $53 trillion by 2025, a third of global AUM” according to Bloomberg Intelligence February 23, 2021 In addition, there never has been so much attention via media, business schools, policy makers, impact network associations, conferences, press releases talking about ESG and Impact. We won! Or did we.

The assorted Social Investment Forums claim 40 Trillion dollars committed to ESG, already, in one shape or form. Are these figures accurate?

Is so much money really going into ESG and Impact, or is the definition incorrect? ESG and Impact have become synonymous with a membership card to a fitness club but never going. Has any of this money really addressed the challenges that they were intended to help, fix or address? 

The environmental and societal challenges the world faces, after all the trillions going into ESG, are staggering. ESG and Impact Investing can’t lay claim to making things better, if you look at the list.

&amp;#x200B;

* Climate Change Destruction
* Biodiversity loss
* Water Shortage
* Food shortage
* Health Crisis (Diabetes)
* Income Inequality (Living Wage)
* Pollution
* Threat of War 

All of the above have grown significantly despite the money flows that were intended to reverse the trend.

What is ESG?

A family office in Singapore asked me to stop by to discuss ESG and Impact Investing, as this family were transitioning from intensive fossils fuels to sustainability. The head of the Family Office said “Robert. We don’t understand how can the most toxic companies score so well on ESG Sustainability Indexes:

&amp;#x200B;

* BP &amp; Shell-Carbon intensive and climate change criminals
* Unilever-Semi-toxic cosmetics and processed food.
* Pepsico-Diabetes from snacks and sugar water”

I had to explain that the methodology used for ESG assessment is not what the company does but how it reports. 

Engagement

If one looks at institutional investors like pension funds, they began claiming ESG alignment because they were engaging with the companies through intermediaries. Engagement was very popular as nothing had to change, the pension funds maintained their positions and an intermediary spoke to the companies that the asset owner wanted to see behavioural change. Were they really changing the behaviour of the companies to address climate risk? Not really.

Impact and ESG Network organisations were building up their members who all were claiming commitment to ESG and Impact. If you “pull up the kimono”, nothing substantial is there. Often empty gestures, but all want to be seen as part of the club, because that is where the money flows were going. Don’t want to miss the party.

The ones who have benefitted from ESG and Impact Investing are.

&amp;#x200B;

* Fund managers (fees)
* Inst. Investor Box Tickers 
* Aspirational Club Members
* Service Providers
* Advisors

Society and the environment has not benefitted.

**Wealth Managers and Nextgen**

On top of the present ESG failure in addressing societal and environmental challenges, the Wealth Management industry has missed the boat in embracing regenerative or investing 2.0. Most of the major private banks, are saying how important sustainable investment is. Yet, for all its importance, why is it that not one major private bank dominates the space. Main reason is that none of these institutions want to the seen as the Impact Bank (Investing 2.0), yet they also don’t want to be not seen as the impact Bank. Commitment is not there.

In addition, most wealth managers miss the opportunity that purpose driven investments provide. With low interest rates, it’s hard to truly get clients inspired. Impact (Investing 2.0) could offer a way to engage with clients, even if it represents a small percentage of portfolio. Sure Impact Investing instills passion and excitement, even if the amount is small. Finally, the coming transfer of wealth to next geners, offers an even greater opportunity to truly move money into investments that are restorative in nature.Gen Z values are not only financially focused. They want to align their values with their investments. As education and infrastructure for Investing 2.0 increases, the market will grow even faster. 

The market is clearly there but the way ESG is done now is just a death march in the wrong direction but slower. Going forward, investment needs to be regenerative in nature. Fortunately, many asset owners are realising this and demanding investment that is regenerative in nature or far less harmful. This message was clearly made with the announcement of the launch of [Net Zero Asset Managers](https://www.netzeroassetmanagers.org/) The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative is an international group of asset managers committed to supporting the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. I hope this is another empty promise wrapped in a shiny press release. We have had enough of that. Let’s stop the ribbon cutting and grab the shovel and do the work and **get mad as hell.**

12,Would planting trees be used as an excuse to not move away from the current polluting status quo?,"I see these news of different countries and groups who are pledging to plant tress by however many number. Of course restoring ecosystems and planting tress that will help us in the long term to combat climate change is wonderful news (especially rewilding). However, whenever I see a country like China or other high economic powers who pledge these deals I always feel sceptic as to what is their true intention in doing so especially when they don't seem to tackle issues that contribute to climate change. Instead I'm afraid that these 'solutions' might be used as an excuse to not change the system but rather like a really bad bandage of ""why do we need to change the system when there is no problem since we are planting trees that will combat the 'problem' in the first place"". 

Of course to truly combat climate change and remove CO2 only through trees  you would need at least 3 trillion trees? (correct me if I'm wrong) So the scale matters too.

13,Slow Life: How to Live a Minimalist Life?,"**Slow Life: How to Live a Minimalist Life?**

Man, there are so many unnecessary things.

The purpose of the minimalist lifestyle is to live minimally, not materially.

Many  people misunderstand that a minimalist lifestyle is to pursue the least  material pursuits and the most empty rooms. A pair of shoes, a set of  clothes, very few electrical appliances. In my opinion, such ""ascetic""  minimalism will only make the current life worse.

The minimalist lifestyle is to face your real needs and think clearly about the relationship between your items and you.

For  example, for me, a computer is not only a tool for receiving  information, but also a carrier for recording information. This often  needs to be performed simultaneously. The dual-screen display is very  practical for me; basketball uniforms generally have 3-5 sets. It can be  changed and washed in time, and can be used as pajamas.

CLICK HERE TO KNOW:  [How to live simply without being a minimalist](https://youtu.be/m6VD8GH6v-c)

A minimalist lifestyle includes not only a reduction in numbers, but also a simplification of processes.

A  little skill for an office worker. The first thing after arriving at  the office every morning is to turn on the phone. During the period, I  will organize and record the work that needs to be done today on a small  strip of A4 paper folded in half. The strips only need to be folded  horizontally and vertically, without cutting, they can be used for  several days. In this way, you can always know your working status.

Therefore,  if you can establish some of your own processes in your daily life, you  will greatly simplify your life. Use Siri to make reminders to set  alarms, manage various account passwords, and classify and label your  friends' documents. There are a set of processes to form habits. , To  minimize the interference of daily chores to life.

A minimalist lifestyle requires time to design and make good use of storage in advance.

For  example, dirty clothes are put in the laundry basket in the washroom,  shopping labels are affixed to the refrigerator, and toilet paper and  razors are placed in handy positions. Wireless charging devices for  mobile phones are placed in the office on the car.

A minimalist lifestyle should focus on the simplification of choices.

Don’t  buy things that you can buy or not. Before you buy, think about what  you can replace. When choosing, remember to be silent for a minute and  see your true desires clearly.

The goal of minimalism should be to save energy by simplifying life and focus on what is worth focusing on.

10. Oh yes, and sustainability.

Sustainability is about the creation of hunan systems which are compatible with the ecosystem. For most of human history, we were hunter-gatherers who ate a meat-heavy diet. And for the whole of this time, that system was sustainable. It was compatibile with the holocene ecosystem.  Well...that's not entirely true, because there was a long-term pattern of extinction of megafauna as a result of human activity. But that's not the same as the entire ecosystem being threatened with collapse, which is what is happening now. The key to the sustainability of that system was the limitation of human numbers. Hunter-gathering just doesn't permit a large enough human population to destabilise the entire system.

There is absolutely no reason why humans cannot create a sustainable system that involves eating meat. What would make it sustainable are these two things:

1. Strictly enforced limits to overall population and consumption.
2. 100% recycling of waste products and 0% dependence on non-renewable resources.

Note that there is no ""veganism"" on this list.

What veganism would do, in *both* an optimally sustainable system *and* in our unsustainable system, is to increase the capacity of the system for human population. If everybody in the world today became a vegan the world would be not one millimetre closer to sustainability.  Similarly, if everybody living in a system meeting the two requirements above was a meat eater, but the limits were set accordingly, then it would not be one millimetre further away from sustainability.

tl;dr ""increased carrying capacity"" is an entirely different thing to ""structurally sustainable.""",sustainability,1624863584

[Earthpositivestore.com](https://earthpositivestore.com/) (that would be the url but you would just refer to the store as Earthpositive. I like it because the logo could be something nice and simple: EARTH+

[Themoralstore.com](https://themoralstore.com/) half of the reason I built this site was so I could donate profits and truly make a good impact on the world. I know a lot of businesses say this in their marketing, but I am really passionate about it. We're going to try to help put on beach clean ups and engage communities and donate to local non-profits when you buy from us.

[earthsavershop.com](https://earthsavershop.com/) I like this because it makes our buyers feel like a hero for shopping with us.

[Conservewhatyoulove.com](https://conservewhatyoulove.com/) Although this is really long. I saw it on a mural and thought it was touching. Its similar to other names out there such as the eco friendly store: ""the future is good"". Abbreviated as [thefig.com](https://thefig.com/)

[Ecossentialsstore.com](https://ecossentialsstore.com/) I combined Eco and essentials. Because we're selling home-essentials that are eco-friendly. Simple enough. The biggest problem I see with this URL is that it is a clever name but it doesn't invoke much emotion.

[skiponplastic.com](https://skiponplastic.com/) I don't know if i like this one. Figured I would just put it in though. The problem is that it makes it seem like the only benefits of buying from plastic free goods is that you're buying goods without plastic however it's so much more than that (manufacturing process, energy usage, ethics, if our supplier donates, etc)

I made a very quick google survey, if you could fill it out I would really really appreciate it :)

HOW THE EVOLUTION OF CAPITALISM CAN SAVE THE PLANET

Dedicated to Jonah - for a better world.

&amp;#x200B;

1.	Rethink?

There are few, if any, areas of life unaffected by COVID-19. Terms including social distancing, PPE and flattening the curve form part of our everyday conversation. We are necessarily denying our most basic human need to be close and connected to one another because of a virus that forces us physically apart. Irony aside, a worldwide pandemic has brought humanity together into a state of shared experience on a level unlike any in history.

In America the lights shone and the water ran; the delivery trucks still rolled. Do we emerge from this nightmare with a sense of triumph, unapologetically returning to the ways of the past? Or do we proceed with the recognition that a world apparently too big to fail sits on an untenably fragile foundation? 

The pandemic is a clarion call that lets us shake off institutional dust that may have settled over time. An unbiased (to the extent possible), open and label-free confrontation of our past is our chance for growth—a true rethink.

At the root of why, with this virus, it is different this time, is a borderless world much more tightly interconnected by trade and travel than it was during the 1918 flu pandemic. Such interconnectedness will work to our advantage if we let it. If we reflect, and turn that reflection into action, we will reach a deeper meaning to this unprecedented global experience.

So how do we make the most of this transition?

2.	Ask ‘Why?’ 

Rather than spouting a list of societal ills, we can examine root causes. The limits and structures of the biological, anthropological and technological realms that so dictate the form of our commerce and development are not fixed, and the outcomes we took for granted are ripe for change. As business reward systems squeezed the last cent out of the marginal customer’s pocket, few of us questioned them, and even fewer of us had the means to offer alternatives. The forces at work were bigger than us. Coordinated, collaborative economic models found no oxygen.

After all, humanity was forged in the same fiery crucible as all life on earth. Consider competition and the law of the jungle: a lion must be the biggest and most savage to ward off rival lions. This winning survival strategy applies to germs, plants, animals and humans. Indeed, the free market and conventional capitalist systems are patterned on it. Over a billion people were lifted out of extreme poverty under this regime over the last thirty years^(1).  Such a rising tide lifted all boats, and we need not minimize its positive effects.

3.	So what?

Still, the rising tide has been anything but uniform. The majority of US earnings growth accrued to the top 20 percent of earners^(2)  and large corporate interests in the last fifty years. Ordinary, hardworking people were left in a very distant second tier. The structural barriers that deny upward mobility kept quality of life nearly stagnant over the same term for the middle and lower classes. This lack of earnings growth has been estimated to equal $2.5 trillion a year, $47 trillion since 1975^(3). 

And why? The short answer, the law of the jungle, dictates that those who hold power hoard power, be it Wall Street bankers, heirs and heiresses to generational fortunes, or corrupt officials. We can observe the historical thread of hoarding, starting with tribal warlords, to monarchs, to the nobility and aristocracy, to the robber barons building the industrialized world, and finally to the utter intoxication of participants in capital markets and government. We also observe little meaningful change to power dynamics along the way.

In the US, layering a democratic government over a free market solves for some of conventional capitalism’s side effects, but perverse incentives are nevertheless cross-pollinated between politics and big business. Furthermore, a constrained government lacks the resources for overwhelming success, and so the bureaucratic class does a poor job with most tasks.

Meanwhile, power hoarders have their thumb on the scale, armed as they are with ruthlessness and a focus on distributive outcomes^(4).  America may be the poster child, but this holds true for basically every place one can think of.

In 2018, the 26 wealthiest people held the same wealth as the bottom 50% of all humanity (3.8 billion people). In 2017 it was the top 43, in 2016 it was the top 61^(5). 

4.	An emerging downside

Where does the status quo lead? A system so inherently and so passionately rivalrous works ‘great’ in yesterday’s world, with a billion people, or two billion people, or perhaps even five billion people—not so much at eight billion. Humanity is bumping up against the carrying capacity of earth’s gifts, with its hand on a tinderbox of social tensions ready to blaze. We are all connected; dire consequences from the next Black Swan event, no matter how far away its geographical origin, will not leave us undamaged.

Hardly a path to survival, the status quo in the real world of environmental resource constraints and outsized social power imbalances looks like an extremely bad bet. If we are not yet careening off a Thelma-&amp;-Louise-style cliff at 100 mph, we’re only a thousand yards away going a good 45 mph. Neither braking nor steering away is an option. We must disassemble, re-engineer, and rebuild that Thunderbird convertible and take to the skies before reaching the precipice. Environmental and social tipping points are real, and we need to be planning for the consequences of crossing our first. We are lucky it didn’t come from this virus. Our addiction to some form of capitalism has been millennia in the making, and the institutional inertia is too great to ignore for one more instant.

The question of whether we can escape the forces that defined our past is existential, and the answer, therefore, binds our very future.

5.	Coordinates of the solution(s)

Does answering the question require entirely new technologies, or can we simply make use of existing technologies in novel ways? What features of existing systems—especially conventional capitalism—can be incorporated into a new and improved system with little disruption to the old and tired way of doing things? What tweaks allow for a stable evolution rather than a violent revolution?

Should such adjustments be available, then superior paths forward reveal themselves absent the attachment to any form of politics, economics or ideology. Taking this one step further: how can the best features of established systems coexist while locking out their worst features and consequences?

6.	The silo of low-hanging fruit

We may well strive for wholesale changes in the laws of the land, the roll call of our political representatives, social justice, the economy, or in our collective relationship to the natural world. Balancing our aims with what is realistic, and with what will move the needle, guides our direction.

While all societal silos^(6)  are probably ripe for a refresh, the focus of this document is commerce and economics. As important as the ballot box, economic participation is a weapon the individual can wield on a daily basis. Whereas political elections take place once every two years, we can vote with our wallet each and every day, and the effects are cumulative.

We are not, however, taking this weapon up in a meaningful way. The low-hanging fruit for effecting change is described by the primary pillar of Sustainablism: a sustainable business organization (SBO).

7.	Sustainable Business Organization (SBO)

How businesses are organized dictates how business is done as a system (see Appendix I). The impact of these choices is profound. These are the four defining organizational principles required by Sustainablist firms:

i)	50% employee ownership, 50% customer ownership

ii)	equitably minded governance

iii)	hyper-transparency 

iv)	externality^(7)  recapture

(See Appendix II for brief explanations of the principles.)

8.	The SBO footprint

Any industry may contain SBOs, but Sustainablist entrepreneurs should endeavor to create a robust ecosystem of SBOs in the following sectors:

i)	agribusiness

ii)	water supply &amp; sanitation

iii)	apparel

iv)	housing &amp; construction

v)	energy supply

vi)	education

vii)	health care

viii)	transportation &amp; mobility

ix)	communications

Self-determined, democratic control over these sectors is the basic outcome targeted by Sustainablism. Universally high-quality access to these resources should be seen as a prerequisite for a high-functioning, Sustainablist society. Given our daily transactions in these domains, we are overlooking almost all of our opportunity to vote for meaningful upward mobility or other forms of change.

9.	Features and consequences of SBOs

Broadly, SBO entrepreneurs work toward three outcomes:

i)	levelling the socioeconomic playing field (rising tides lift all boats equitably)

ii)	establishing superior economic equilibria^(8)  and outcomes

iii)	reducing the work of government

All four of the SBO organizational principles from section 7 play a role in achieving these outcomes, but a special focus on superior economic equilibria (see Appendix III and this section) makes the strongest case.

To explore what is different in an SBO ecosystem, we have to understand the status quo (see Appendix IV), namely that the basic stock and trade of power hoarders is asymmetric information^(9),  the fungibility of power^(10),  and differential advantage^(11).  These are the thumb-on- the-scale effects that result in errors in the attribution of profit—and, ultimately, inequity.

Profit is a crucial component of SBO transactions, and it is attributed to a firm’s individual owners just as in conventional capitalism. The traditionally accepted view of capitalism is that the pursuit of profit should be the primary goal of the firm. This need not change under Sustainablism. Obviously, should the owners of a firm wish to keep realizing this profit, then decisions that would lead to the collapse of the firm must be avoided. Although there are many decisions to be made for a working SBO, the most important for our immediate discussion relates to setting the market clearing price^(12)  on any good or service.

Let us compare price-setting under conventional capitalism and Sustainablism. Under the former, no firm will:

•	increase prices beyond the point where customers are willing to purchase the good or service produced by the firm: no willingness to pay = no sales = no firm = no profit for the owners

•	decrease prices beyond the point the firm can cover the cost of producing the good or service: no means of production = no sales = no firm = no profit for the owners^(13)  

Firms naturally seek the highest possible price for their goods and services, and customers seek the lowest possible price. This tension is settled by the free market and the forces of supply and demand.

In contrast, Sustainablism establishes or assumes the following to achieve equilibrium:

•	firms are composed of employees (specifically, the managerial class^(14)) who set the prices of their goods and services

•	sales are executed with customers, who accept the sales price

•	this setting and acceptance of prices is required for a transaction to take place

•	transactions create profits for owners

•	owners want continuing profits

•	because owners want continuing profits, they will make decisions that ensure the long-term life of the firm (rather than its destruction)

•	Sustainablist firms are 50:50 owned by employees and customers

•	Because ownership of Sustainablist firms is held equally by employees and customers, they must therefore fairly resolve any underlying tensions to set prices so that transactions can take place for themselves, as owners, to realize profit

Under the SBO framework, every transaction involves owners seeking fairness and long-term sustainability. The effect cascades up and down the supply chain because the sellers of goods and services to end consumers are indeed customers themselves (and therefore owners) of their suppliers^(15).  Instead of fighting over 100 percent ‘ownership’ of one side of every transaction, an assemblage of SBO firms effectively becomes 50 percent owners of all sides of every transaction in a given supply chain, with consumption restricted to the goods and services customers actually want to buy, as profit-seeking owners.

Ownership is by far the most important path to wealth and is therefore the most important means of levelling the socioeconomic playing field. Furthermore, with ownership supercharging agency, Sustainablist outcomes flowing from the bottom up gain more traction.

None of this requires the necessary government interventions found in conventional capitalism, nor the central command found in real-world applications of communism (these systems are two sides of the same law-of-the-jungle coin). Nothing conceptual should prevent us from having the same economy under Sustainablism as we do today. If producing a 99¢ hamburger involves cutting down the Brazilian rainforest for grazing and paying burger flippers near poverty wages, and if all economic actors, including customers, workers and resource suppliers, collectively decide^(16)  that what matters is producing that 99¢ hamburger, then that is what we get under Sustainablism. Hyper-transparency requires us to do this with our eyes open, externality recapture assigns a dollar cost to repairing the rainforest, and 50:50 ownership makes paying a living wage a necessity (otherwise we fail to attract any employees). While our Sustainablist stipulations mean we might not have a 99¢ hamburger anymore, whatever arrangements or product we are left with—a pricier, healthier foodstuff or a healthier food-supply chain—will, by definition, increase to the stock of society’s profit.

The superior outcomes resulting from superior equilibria drives economic efficiencies and fosters a mindset of coordination. The pursuit of profit under Sustainablism is a unifying force rather than a rivalrous one.

Because consumers, firms and resource suppliers—all economic actors in a Sustainablist framework—make decisions based on self-interest and against self-harm, government expenditure on legislating, regulating or policing corporate activity is meaningfully reduced. By relying on corporations that actually self-regulate with integrity, Sustainablism leads to smaller government while affording the free market leeway to solve our challenges in a coordinated fashion. Sustainablism’s end game, if you will, sees government focused on foreign relations^(17),  the military, large public works and taxation.

Sustainablism’s simple, natural efficiencies of less regulation and inherent cooperation achieve positive change without a forced redistribution of wealth away from power hoarders in the form of higher taxes. Sustainablism moves the invisible hand of the free market, wherever it hovers over the dark side, into the light.

The 50:50 ownership structure stipulated for SBOs is crucial for true long-term sustainability. Equilibrium is balance; any tilt towards one party introduces a drifting force and an eventual reversion to something that looks much like the status quo. Furthermore, the 50:50 structure leads to a positive blurring of the lines of the firm as individual links in supply chains coordinate more and more to produce the best goods and services possible. As the ethos of Sustainablism achieves a meaningful hold on market participants, new entrants may propose alternate ownership structures, but the reader is cautioned that these may amount to a fatal flaw^(18)  and could be the mark of mere virtue-signallers.

For Sustainablism to take hold, consumers will have to vote with their wallets in favor of SBOs. Amenable voters would number in the hundreds of millions, and they should be easy to activate in this particular moment of our history.

To the extent the ideas in this paper resonate, readers need to act to create this demand. If the clawing of power hoarders at the walls of democracy disgusts you, strongly consider your creative role by supporting emerging Sustainablist businesses. Power hoarders don’t yet realize that the bricks they tear down are the same which fortify their vaults.

10.	So, how?

There are only three fundamental problems that need to be solved before Sustainablism can gain a meaningful foothold in the real economy:

i)	the resource problem;

ii)	the technology problem; and

iii)	the coordination problem

We are very fortunate to be living in an age—for now—when we have yet to cross the line marking a general availability of resources. Society needs to act well before this changes.

The technology problem^(19)  is a matter of combining existing solutions rather than one of invention. It can be solved, likely within twelve months, given sufficient resources. Conveniently, this is probably around the same amount of time it will take to fully transition out of a COVID world.

This leaves the coordination problem. The plan for answering that can be found at [https://dunbarscafe.com/](https://dunbarscafe.com/the_plan_and_next_steps.php).

11.	Common criticisms

This is naïve and idealistic

This is optimistic—and there is a massive difference. Whether we experience an economic recession or expansion, it is nothing more than a self-fulfilling prophecy. When people are generally optimistic about their circumstances, they work and spend and the economy grows. When people are generally pessimistic, they cut back on spending, some lose their jobs and the economy shrinks. It really is as simple as that, and we need not shy away from this linkage. We should be leaning into this property and applying it to other areas of commerce. At its core, the establishment of Sustainablism represents the weaponization of optimism in a parallel economy. If people are made aware of Sustainablism and are conceptually tuned to demand the goods and services offered by SBOs, SBOs will form and fill this need^(20). 

Sustainablism doesn’t require everyone’s optimism to be feasible; pessimists will remain in the larger, original system for some time. If Sustainablism is to become the dominant system, however, it does require the optimists to outcompete the pessimists. Within the fundamentally cooperative infrastructure set by SBOs, and with a levelling of the playing field that results, this should prove eminently workable.

Meanwhile, pessimists will convert to optimism in a virtuous cycle. Why? Pessimists aren’t really pessimists, they just don’t see another way. Optimists need to start showing them one, and there are certainly enough of us out there. In other words, once we hit Sustainablist critical mass, it will trigger a positive social tipping point.

This is communism/socialism

Every communist and socialist society submits to the heavy hand of central planning, bloated bureaucracies, public ownership and power hoarding that characterizes conventional capitalism. This is in opposition to what is described by Sustainablism.

Unlike communism, Sustainablism is not in conflict with conventional capitalism in any way whatsoever. Indeed, it is a form of capitalism and uses the same levers—no revolution required. With a bit of insight we can ‘hack’ our economy and change the status quo and its consequences.

The Sustainablist system relies on individual choice and private ownership to direct the economy. The profit from transactions is not directed to the single commons of socialism^(21);  rather, people direct their transactions to a commons that they themselves define, own and control. In other words, those that create profit decide where that value goes. Sustainablism is the most democratic and freedom-aligned way of organizing economic infrastructure.

This will stifle innovation

If the ownership share of entrepreneurs, as the founders of SBO firms, is reduced as it is shared with employees and customers, will they have the incentive to innovate in the first place? Firstly, money’s role as a motivator is overestimated when the fate of the planet is at stake, especially for millennials and Generation Z. Secondly, founders can still command very high compensation through their salaries. Finally, the initial ecosystem of SBOs will be focused on rolling out and scaling up existing technology in food, housing, and energy to consumers rather than creating new technologies. There is plenty of incentive for the  development of new technologies within the status quo of concentrated founder ownership, venture capital, and institutional investment in IPOs. A transitional stage may last decades, and we will not likely see innovative, high-risk startups organized as SBOs until a new generation of entrepreneurs is born into a Sustainablist economic system.

This off-ramp of sorts puts society into two classes: the innovative class, which develops new technology under the status quo, and the virtuous class, which scales existing technology using SBOs. These labels are for convenience only and are not meant to be mutually exclusive; the innovative class needs to be virtuous and the virtuous class needs to be innovative.

12.	Conclusion 

Sustainablism is a centrist approach to economic thought,  the design of which should appeal to everyone across the political spectrum. It encompasses the ideals of universal access to food, shelter and the like while clinging tightly to the free market, private ownership and the maintenance of a class system. It is capitalist with respect to rules and processes and socially conscious with respect to outcomes.

Business can no longer afford to look the other way; stakeholders increasingly demand that commercial enterprise align with their values. The four organizational principles of SBOs guarantees this alignment across different supply chains and through the economy. Sustainablism requires no new technologies, and it incorporates some of the best features of existing economic systems while locking out their worst features.

In a free market system where competition ensures that humanity is always in its best age in the present moment, it is naïve to assume that there is no room for improvement. If the availability of the latest and greatest &lt;insert your favorite product here&gt; is a result of efficient competition between the elements within a system, what healthy outcomes arise from competition between parallel systems? Add the field of business organization to the list of those undergoing a restructuring in 2021.

While Sustainablism may not prove to be the answer, it is a very good candidate as a starting point. This paper is meant to jumpstart us into actually living the search for a new way of doing things and not just having a conversation about it. ‘Innovate or die’ never rang more true than it does today.

As we look toward a world without COVID-19, we ask: What world do we want to emerge into? How will we reconnect with each other? What will future generations say about what we made out of these circumstances and our legacy? Will the human world ultimately be one of stewardship and balance? Or will it be one of ruin? If your answer is the same as mine, let’s make the world a better place together.

# Ten Strikes Against Nuclear Energy

[https://www.greenamerica.org/fight-dirty-energy/amazon-build-cleaner-cloud/10-reasons-oppose-nuclear-energy](https://www.greenamerica.org/fight-dirty-energy/amazon-build-cleaner-cloud/10-reasons-oppose-nuclear-energy)

**1. Nuclear waste:**

The waste generated by nuclear reactors remains radioactive for tens to hundreds of thousands of years (1). Currently, there are no long-term storage solutions for radioactive waste, and most is stored in temporary, above-ground facilities. These facilities are running out of storage space, so the nuclear industry is turning to other types of storage that are more costly and potentially less safe (2).

**2. Nuclear proliferation:**

There is great concern that the development of nuclear energy programs increases the likelihood of proliferation of nuclear weapons. As nuclear fuel and technologies become globally available, the risk of these falling into the wrong hands is increasingly present. To avoid weapons proliferation, it is important that countries with high levels of corruption and instability be discouraged from creating nuclear programs, and the US should be a leader in nonproliferation by not pushing for more nuclear power at home (3).

**3. National security**

Nuclear power plants are a potential target for terrorist operations. An attack could cause major explosions, putting population centers at risk, as well as ejecting dangerous radioactive material into the atmosphere and surrounding region. Nuclear research facilities, uranium enrichment plants, and uranium mines are also potentially at risk for attacks that could cause widespread contamination with radioactive material (9).

**4. Accidents**

In addition to the risks posed by terrorist attacks, human error and natural disasters can lead to dangerous and costly accidents. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine led to the deaths of 30 employees in the initial explosion and has has had a variety of negative health effects on thousands across Russia and Eastern Europe. A massive tsunami bypassed the safety mechanisms of several power plants in 2011, causing three nuclear meltdowns at a power plant in Fukushima, Japan, resulting in the release of radioactive materials into the surrounding area. In both disasters, hundreds of thousands were relocated, millions of dollars spent, and the radiation-related deaths are being evaluated to this day. Cancer rates among populations living in proximity to Chernobyl and Fukushima, especially among children, rose significantly in the years after the accidents (4)(5).

**5. Cancer risk**

In addition to the significant risk of cancer associated with fallout from nuclear disasters, studies also show increased risk for those who reside near a nuclear power plant, especially for childhood cancers such as leukemia (6)(7)(8). Workers in the nuclear industry are also exposed to higher than normal levels of radiation, and as a result are at a higher risk of death from cancer (10).

**6. Energy production**

The 444 nuclear power plants currently in existence provide about 11% of the world’s energy (11). Studies show that in order to meet current and future energy needs, the nuclear sector would have to scale up to around 14,500 plants. Uranium, the fuel for nuclear reactors, is energy-intensive to mine, and deposits discovered in the future are likely to be harder to get to to. As a result, much of the net energy created would be offset by the energy input required to build and decommission plants and to mine and process uranium ore. The same is true for any reduction in greenhouse gas emissions brought about by switching from coal to nuclear (12).

**7. Not enough sites**

Scaling up to 14,500 nuclear plants isn’t possible simply due to the limitation of feasible sites. Nuclear plants need to be located near a source of water for cooling, and there aren’t enough locations in the world that are safe from droughts, flooding, hurricanes, earthquakes, or other potential disasters that could trigger a nuclear accident. The increase in extreme weather events predicted by climate models only compounds this risk.

**8. Cost**

Unlike renewables, which are now the cheapest energy sources, nuclear costs are on the rise, and many plants are being shut down or in danger of being shut down for economic reasons. Initial capital costs, fuel, and maintenance costs are much higher for nuclear plants than wind and solar, and nuclear projects tend to suffer [cost overruns](https://www.greenamerica.org/blog/more-evidence-strike-8-against-nuclear-power) and construction delays. The price of renewable energy has fallen significantly over the past decade, and it projected to continue to fall (14).

**9. Competition with renewables**

Investment in nuclear plants, security, mining infrastructure, etc. draws funding away from investment in cleaner sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal. Financing for renewable energy is already scarce, and increasing nuclear capacity will only add to the competition for funding.

**10. Energy dependence of poor countries**

Going down the nuclear route would mean that poor countries, that don't have the financial resources to invest in and develop nuclear power, would become reliant on rich, technologically advanced nations. Alternatively, poor nations without experience in the building and maintaining of nuclear plants may decide to build them anyway. Countries with a history of nuclear power use have learned the importance of regulation, oversight, and investment in safety when it comes to nuclear. Dr. Peter Bradford of Vermont Law, a former member of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, writes, ""A world more reliant on nuclear power would involve many plants in countries that have little experience with nuclear energy, no regulatory background in the field and some questionable records on quality control, safety and corruption."" (15). The U.S. should lead by example and encourage poor countries to invest in safe energy technology.

These are the real numbers:

Nuclear is 4-10 times more expensive than solar or wind per KW, takes billions in up front costs, many years to build, has security and safety issues and relies on a finite resource that will run out.

Nuclear can't compete because it is too slow, too expensive , leaves toxic waste, is a target for terrorists and no one wants it near their homes.

""Plans to build an innovative new nuclear power plant—and thus revitalize the struggling U.S. nuclear industry—have taken a hit as in recent weeks: Eight of the 36 public utilities that had signed on to help build the plant have backed out of the deal. The withdrawals come just months after the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS), which intends to buy the plant containing 12 small modular reactors from NuScale Power, announced that completion of the project would be delayed by 3 years to 2030. It also estimates the cost would climb from $4.2 billion to $6.1 billion.""

These are the real numbers:

Nuclear is 4-10 times more expensive than solar or wind per KW, takes billions in up front costs, many years to build, has security and safety issues and relies on a finite resource that will run out.

Nuclear can't compete because it is too slow, too expensive , leaves toxic waste, is a target for terrorists and no one wants it near their homes.

""Plans to build an innovative new nuclear power plant—and thus revitalize the struggling U.S. nuclear industry—have taken a hit as in recent weeks: Eight of the 36 public utilities that had signed on to help build the plant have backed out of the deal. The withdrawals come just months after the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS), which intends to buy the plant containing 12 small modular reactors from NuScale Power, announced that completion of the project would be delayed by 3 years to 2030.

35,10 Reasons to Oppose Nuclear Energy,"## Ten Strikes Against Nuclear Energy

[https://www.greenamerica.org/fight-dirty-energy/amazon-build-cleaner-cloud/10-reasons-oppose-nuclear-energy](https://www.greenamerica.org/fight-dirty-energy/amazon-build-cleaner-cloud/10-reasons-oppose-nuclear-energy)

## 1. Nuclear waste:

The waste generated by nuclear reactors remains radioactive for tens to hundreds of thousands of years (1). Currently, there are no long-term storage solutions for radioactive waste, and most is stored in temporary, above-ground facilities. These facilities are running out of storage space, so the nuclear industry is turning to other types of storage that are more costly and potentially less safe (2).

## 2. Nuclear proliferation:

There is great concern that the development of nuclear energy programs increases the likelihood of proliferation of nuclear weapons. As nuclear fuel and technologies become globally available, the risk of these falling into the wrong hands is increasingly present. To avoid weapons proliferation, it is important that countries with high levels of corruption and instability be discouraged from creating nuclear programs, and the US should be a leader in nonproliferation by not pushing for more nuclear power at home (3).

## 3. National security

Nuclear power plants are a potential target for terrorist operations. An attack could cause major explosions, putting population centers at risk, as well as ejecting dangerous radioactive material into the atmosphere and surrounding region. Nuclear research facilities, uranium enrichment plants, and uranium mines are also potentially at risk for attacks that could cause widespread contamination with radioactive material (9).

## 4. Accidents

In addition to the risks posed by terrorist attacks, human error and natural disasters can lead to dangerous and costly accidents. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine led to the deaths of 30 employees in the initial explosion and has has had a variety of negative health effects on thousands across Russia and Eastern Europe. A massive tsunami bypassed the safety mechanisms of several power plants in 2011, causing three nuclear meltdowns at a power plant in Fukushima, Japan, resulting in the release of radioactive materials into the surrounding area. In both disasters, hundreds of thousands were relocated, millions of dollars spent, and the radiation-related deaths are being evaluated to this day. Cancer rates among populations living in proximity to Chernobyl and Fukushima, especially among children, rose significantly in the years after the accidents (4)(5).

## 5. Cancer risk

In addition to the significant risk of cancer associated with fallout from nuclear disasters, studies also show increased risk for those who reside near a nuclear power plant, especially for childhood cancers such as leukemia (6)(7)(8). Workers in the nuclear industry are also exposed to higher than normal levels of radiation, and as a result are at a higher risk of death from cancer (10).

## 6. Energy production

The 444 nuclear power plants currently in existence provide about 11% of the world’s energy (11). Studies show that in order to meet current and future energy needs, the nuclear sector would have to scale up to around 14,500 plants. Uranium, the fuel for nuclear reactors, is energy-intensive to mine, and deposits discovered in the future are likely to be harder to get to to. As a result, much of the net energy created would be offset by the energy input required to build and decommission plants and to mine and process uranium ore. The same is true for any reduction in greenhouse gas emissions brought about by switching from coal to nuclear (12).

## 7. Not enough sites

Scaling up to 14,500 nuclear plants isn’t possible simply due to the limitation of feasible sites. Nuclear plants need to be located near a source of water for cooling, and there aren’t enough locations in the world that are safe from droughts, flooding, hurricanes, earthquakes, or other potential disasters that could trigger a nuclear accident. The increase in extreme weather events predicted by climate models only compounds this risk.

## 8. Cost

Unlike renewables, which are now the cheapest energy sources, nuclear costs are on the rise, and many plants are being shut down or in danger of being shut down for economic reasons. Initial capital costs, fuel, and maintenance costs are much higher for nuclear plants than wind and solar, and nuclear projects tend to suffer [cost overruns](https://www.greenamerica.org/blog/more-evidence-strike-8-against-nuclear-power) and construction delays. The price of renewable energy has fallen significantly over the past decade, and it projected to continue to fall (14).

## 9. Competition with renewables

Investment in nuclear plants, security, mining infrastructure, etc. draws funding away from investment in cleaner sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal. Financing for renewable energy is already scarce, and increasing nuclear capacity will only add to the competition for funding.

## 10. Energy dependence of poor countries

Going down the nuclear route would mean that poor countries, that don't have the financial resources to invest in and develop nuclear power, would become reliant on rich, technologically advanced nations. Alternatively, poor nations without experience in the building and maintaining of nuclear plants may decide to build them anyway. Countries with a history of nuclear power use have learned the importance of regulation, oversight, and investment in safety when it comes to nuclear. Dr. Peter Bradford of Vermont Law, a former member of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, writes, ""A world more reliant on nuclear power would involve many plants in countries that have little experience with nuclear energy, no regulatory background in the field and some questionable records on quality control, safety and corruption."" (15). The U.S. should lead by example and encourage poor countries to invest in safe energy technology.

My question is:

Are these set ups too good to be true? Or do they actually work these wonders. If so, why is this not being funded as like “everyone has 5-10 tanks in their backyards or on the roof of their house” scenario, in a way that collectively a lot of these scrubbers are out there, helping to clean the air ?

41,How much is too much,"I was thinking about benchmarks to help consumers gauge for themselves if they are spending too much.  Isn’t it true that the reason a country like the USA (and I’m an American) has so much wealth is because they extract wealth and de-develop resource-rich nations in the Global South. But, if Americans, consumed less then there wouldn’t be such an impetus to extract so many resources in the rest of the world. 
Is it true that if I consume more than my fair share, that means someone else in the world is consuming less than their fair share?
So, what if we took the average global income (which is about $18,000/year) as a fair benchmark and say that each American only has the right to $18,000 worth of resources per year, and if they are spending more than that (unless they make efforts to purchase fair trade or sustainable products) they are consuming more than they have a right too.

42,DID YOU KNOW ONLINE DATA ALSO POLLUTES?,"When we upload a file or a photo this has an impact on the environment. Why? Because this info it is send to physical node.

All of this is avoidable, in the World there are many people that have some storage capacity empty. This nodes are already functioning and therefore consuming, so it is more respectful for the environment to use this space that is already there but it is unused than create new storage space that is going to contribute to damage the environment.

44,Organic ≠ better,"The assumption is often made that organic food is better for the environment. That is not true. It many cases it is, but in many it is not. As with most things in life, it is more complex than that and there are nuances to consider.

My name is Andrew (@wild\_biologist) I am a researcher in Agricultural Sustainability and in this post I go into some detail about the differneces between *organic* and *conventional* agriculture and the types of things we may want to consider when comparing them. I am not saying, nor believe, that either are inherrently better. I support and buy from a variety of farms including both organic and conventional. This may be slightly UK centric, but it does apply more widely.

**TL;DR** at the bottom

**Location** \- The suitability of organic production methods will vary greatly based on localised environmental factors such as soil type. Picking the right production methods for your environment is more important than if you chose to be organic or not. 

The country you are in will also make a huge differnece. The requirements for organic certification vary worldwide, the laws (and their enforcement) regarding fertiliser and pesticide inputs in conventional systems will also vary. Furthermore, the typical producton system has to be considered. Taking beef as an example, in the UK the overwhelming majority is outdoor grass fed. Where as in the US a far larger proportion of beef is produced using imported grain. The difference between these two systems may be more signficiant than any difference between organic and conventional systems.

To give one annecdotal example: I worked on a project looking at wheat production and fertiliser use in China. The soil was so devoid of nutrients it acted almost exclusively as an anchor for the plants. Fertliser had to be used for the plants to grow, but the gratuitous amounts used and the soils inability to hold the nutrients was leading to huge run-off and damage to environmental and human health. This would simply not need to or be allowed to happen in many other countries.

**Fertilisers** \- Fertiliser run-off is a major envrionmental risk. The careful application of fertiliser is absolutely crucial to any system, organic or conventional. Timing it with the weather, knowing how much to apply and where. 

*Inorganic* fertilisers have an inherrent production and transportation footprint. But we must realise that they do serve a purpose to increase yields, which must be balanced against that cost. A notable benefit is that inorganic fertilisers are a known entity. With modern precision farming, it is now more feasible than ever to know and apply accurate amounts of fertiliser. This is far more difficult with organic fertilisers as the nutrient contents are more variable and unknown. These fertilisers also have notable emissions once deposited. 

One issue we have is that most countries have discrete livestock regions and arrable regions. Therefore, the organic fertlisers (manures) are not near the crops they could provie nutrients for. But, this issue is caused by the reasonably fair logic that some land areas are unsuitable for crops.

Fertilisers cost money and nutrient run off is money being washed away. No farmer wants to apply a single gram more fertiliser than thay absolutely need to and we are getting better and better at ensuring that - but still work to be done.

**Pesticides** \- This isn't a circle to be squared. Pesticides struggle to be specific enough and do impact non-target specis significantly. However, similar to inorganic fertilisers, they do serve a purpose to increase yields. These two factors must be considerd in the context of...

**Land use efficiency** \- This is where the increased yields through inorganic fertilisers and pestiides are important. Organic farming typically has significantly lower yields than conventional. Consequently, a greater land area is used to produce the same amount of food. For many crops a -20% yield would be a conservative estimate. Taking that example, we have to ask what that extra land could be used for. For example... 8km2 of conventional barley + 2km2 of woodland/flower meadow might be better, on the whole, than 10km2 of organic barley. But perhaps that spare 2km2 wouldn't be used like that. The impact of increasing agricultural land use has to be weighted against the impact of fertilisers and pesticides. The best option will likely vary case by case.

This is especially problematic for crops grown in rainforest regions. The production of organic cacao and coffee has led to excess deforestation of high-value rainforest. Speaking to arguably the world expert on sustainably cacoa production, I was told, in no uncertain terms, to avoid organic chocolate.

A recent article in *Nature* suggests that if the entirity of the UK switched to organic farming, that net greenhouse gas emission would increase as a consequence, due to the increase in land required: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12622-7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12622-7)

I cannot stress enough the importance of land use efficiency. It is very difficult to quantify and often ignored when considering the environmental impact and/or GHG impact of organic foods. As our population continues to expand, this will become more and more crucial.

**Livestock** \- I wanted to briefly mention that most organic certifications have good criteria for livestock, for example outdoor grazing requirements. I don't buy meat, but I do by organic milk, though in part because it's the easiest for me to acquire locally + zero waste.

A potential issue with organic livestock is slower growth rates, which lead to more lifetime GHG emissions.

**Organic box ticking -** Becomming certified organic requires ticking various boxes. To some extent this can be arbitary. I've met farmers who meet the criteria but don't certify. I've met farmers who exceed all other criteria, but fell foul of one of them. An organic dairy farmer I met had to bring his cattle in early one year due to weather conditions, but lost his organic certification as a result, he now no longer bothers. What I'm saying is that a huge number of conventional farms may be quite close to organic, exceeding the requirements in many ways, but not be certified.

Many conventional farmers employ much of the same tips and tricks that organic farmers do; increased legumes for N sequestration, diversifying pastures, providing habitat for wildlife (which can control pests) etc. Such techniques are not exclusive to organic.

**Genetic modification** \- I have no idea how this sub views genetic modfiication. As an environmental scientist whose #No.1 mission and passion is to mitigate environmental damage and protect the planet, I am in favour of the expansion of genetically modified crops into the mass consumer market. As far as I know, no organic certification in the world allows for the inclusion of genetically modified crops, which I feel is a mistake. They hold the potential to reduce fertiliser and pesticide use, whilst maintaining or increasing yields and therefore land use efficiency. The technology can be incredibly safe, arguably more so than selective breeding, especially if intraspecific. 

**Sampling bias** \- Farmers who choose to go organic have made a consciencsious decission. The nature of this means that they are typically farmers who are innovative, are especially consciencious of nature, and pay attention to detail and work hard. One I know has introduced wild beavers to his farm! Whilst these traits are true of a huge number of conventional farmers, I would hesitate to say that it is especially true of organic farmers. I know when I visit an organic farmer, I will be meeting someone who is excited about farming and what they do. Consequently, when looking at organic farms, you are also looking at exceedingly good farmers. It is often the fact that they are good farmers that makes their systems good, not necessarily because it is organic.

**Summary** \- Organic is not a synonym for sustainability, though it is an important part of it. More important is how well a farm is managed - their restraint and control of fertilisers and pesticides, and their utilisation of natrual capital. An organic farm can do huge enviornmental damage, though the worst case scenario is not as bad as a convential farms maximum potential damage. On the other hand, a perfeclty managed conventional farm is likely to produce more food, for less environmental cost, than a perfectly managed organic farm. As with most things, it's a balance of risk and rewards and how much we can trust those in charge of managing that risk.

That's it for now. Undoubtedly there will be things missed, but I think I covered the main bases, though I may add some info on later as it comes to me.

**TL;DR** \- buy local, buy seasonal, buy zero waste, buy from farms you know are good. There a positives and negatives of organic and conventional production - with no clear winner",sustainability,1603620363
45,"Looking into ways to reduce my plastic waste, any suggestions for food products with no plastic packaging?","I'm looking into trying to find ways to use less plastic without giving up a whole lot of the life I've become accustomed to, since I'm pretty sure I'll be more likely to keep that up. So, I'm using disposable bamboo utensils for those days/events I don't feel like doing dishes, trying to find brands that use cardboard/glass/metal packaging rather than plastic. My goal isn't to really reduce my waste, but to produce waste that is either sustainably and realistically recycled or biodegradable. 

So I'm looking for suggestions for food brands that use sustainable packaging, since the food industry is rife with plastic. Preferably ones that have online stores that ship to the US, since it's kind of a toss up whether small or specialty brands will be in a supermarket near me. Mainly looking for snacks and jarred or dry goods, since I'm trying to get my perishables from local farmers markets. Extra bonus points if they're certified humane. No restrictions on diet.

Rice and bread are especially hard to find in anything other than plastic bags near me. And it's hard to tell if things like cereals or crackers use plastic or wax paper liners from the shelf. I've definitely had a cereal that looked like it used a wax paper liner, but I can't remember the brand. And if anyone has a veggie or sweet potato chip that's plastic free, *please* do share. I *love* Terra brand, but their bags feel like they use plastic.

Some suggestions I've found:

* Cabot cheeses use wax paper instead of plastic and are pretty found consistently in the US as far as I'm aware. Nonrecyclable, but biodegradable. 
* Any canned drink rather than plastic bottles, since cleaned aluminum and cardboard are easier to recycle or biodegradable. Glass bottles are great, too, but I think everyone knows that.
* True paper plates instead of styrofoam or plastic. EverSpring is a pressed paper plate that's heavy duty and microwavable. But even the cheaper flimsy wax paper plates are better in my book. Nonrecyclable, but biodegradable. 
* Timofey bamboo disposable utensils are relatively affordable and look nice for parties. Nonrecyclable, but biodegradable. 

That's about all I've got that's solid, besides that things that normally come in glass jars/cans like soups, canned veggies, and pasta sauces. I don't get preserved fruits often, but I definitely opt for canned instead of the plastic fruit cups, I guess. 

Feel free to let me know if I'm mistaken or missing something about any of my suggestions! Thanks in advanced!",sustainability,1602449742

47,Introducing Ecopin: A concept for a social media platform to encourage sustainability and community strengthening.,"Ecopin is my concept for a social media platform that incorporates ""social mapping"" to strengthen communities and encourage environmental sustainability.  [The best description of the project is on my website here.](https://www.blbuckley.com/ecopin)

https://preview.redd.it/3y7smzln17v41.jpg?width=1275&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57cb6ecacd165b8141dfb84b080103a849603afe

*Before you read I want to state two things, first if you think you have seen a similar post before, you have. I posted the project a few months ago under the name ""invi"" in a few environmental subreddits. I gained a good amount of support from the posts and I am very grateful! The second thing I must state is that clearly I am not encouraging anybody to go out in their communities now, hopefully by the time this project is actually finished covid will no longer be such a massive threat to society.*

&amp;#x200B;

To put it simply, ecopin  is a map where users can add ""pins"" for others in their community to see. Green pins are sustainable businesses, social services, environmental spots, etc. Blue pins can be pretty much any event in your community. Red pins are sites that are a threat to either the environment, the health of a community, or both.

The goal of social mapping as a social media platform is to bring attention to both the positive and negative things going around in a community. For example, in a neighboring town to mine, there is a trailer park where cancer rates are insanely high due to MTBE groundwater from an abandoned gas station from the 80's. One day I came across a man who lived there and was advocating about how he was going to bring it up to the state capitol … and then he mentioned how I also live near another MTBE leak site in my hometown. If I never ran into that man, I would have never known about either of these contaminated sites. With ecopin, those MTBE sites would be big red marks for everyone in the surrounding communities to see, and all of those eyes will turn to the big wigs trying to brush the issue under the rug.

There are two goals of ecopin, and I believe both will help the environment. The first goal is exposing the good and bad sustainability practices in a community through the social mapping system. The more people see, the more people will care. The second goal is to strengthen communities by encouraging user to participate and create local events. I believe that a large reason why we are so divided and hateful today is because we live increasingly sheltered lives. The more we go out in our communities, the more we see the people who live around us, as well as the diverse opinions these people hold. As we see people who share differing opinions, and talk to them in a civilized manner, we realize that not all of our differences are bad. Heck you might even convince a climate change denier that the environment is in danger. I believe that as we overcome hatred and division, the health of the planet we live on becomes less of a partisan issue.

[Since a prototype hasn't been created, I cannot create a Kickstarter quite yet, instead I created a Patreon for the time being.](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=33155583&amp;fan_landing=true) I am also looking into messaging different environmental companies and organizations to see if I can receive their support as well, groups such as the Sierra Club and Project Sunrise are a few that come to mind. If you have any groups you think I should share the project with feel free to comment them!

Now, where is ecopin now in terms of development? Personally, I am only a graphic artist, so sadly I cannot program this project, only design it and plot out how I want it to function. Since I first shared the project a few months ago, I was able to find a handful of programmers interested in the project. Last week we decided that open sourcing the project would be the best path forward, we haven't really  begun coding yet because we want to build our team some more so it is more organized.

I am looking for anybody willing to donate their time to help with this project. I am not only looking for programmers, but also environmental activists, leaders, artists and designers who are passionate about sustainability and would want to be a part of this project. While I created the concept, I want the final product to be community driven.

49,Why do we think so differently when it comes to emotional and logical decisions?,"I was just thinking about different ways that I shop and how at times it can be quite contradictory. eg sometimes I'm very emotionally driven and other times far more logical about my choices.

For example, emotionally, knowing about the origins of a product helps connect with it, where as logically I'll try and look for things like it's co2 emmisions. Depending on my mood can sway my decision.

What information about a product that a brand provides really gives you that feeling of trust, that their claims are true emotionally vs logically?",sustainability,1582310627
50,What is unfair balance?,"You already know that social entrepreneurs are often called Changemakers - creators of change and revolutionists. However, in order to achieve large or small changes, it is not necessary to always call for radical measures. You need to have an excellent sense of balance and understand the laws of social system’s development. Why do some problems can be solved quickly while others stay unresolved for decades? That's what I want to start talking about.

Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus described a clear order of action that should be followed by a social entrepreneur:

1. Find a stable but unfair balance.

2. Find a solution that will make a difference.

3. Set a new fair balance.

What balances are we talking about? An unfair balance means discrimination against a group that lacks the resources and influences to make a difference. Harassment or problem exists for a long time and in this sense it is stable. Society may not know about the problem, or may consider harassment normal (for example decriminalization of LGBT's in some countries). In any case, the problem is reproduced and not solved.

The task of a social entrepreneur is to find a solution that can change the existing order of things. It requires offering a new approach to the problem, testing the solution, making sure it works and then scaling the results.

The results need to be perceived as a new norm, a self-evident value, as a fair balance. When it comes to everyday practices and rituals, the majority of people need to treat minorities in a different, non-discriminating way. 

To put it bluntly, social entrepreneurs eliminate familiar practices which at the same time are not fair. When something becomes familiar, we start to consider it normal. We are used to plastic pollution, climate change, nightmare news in press, growing gap between rich and poor. We get along with it, although we understand that it's not right at all. This is an unfair balance. The situation is not pleasant, but people reproduce it and don't try to change. In words they may resent, complain, demand, but they don’t take actions in order to change something. Let us look at the example of education. I will talk about my country – Russia, as I know its situation best. 

Current model of russian education kills creativity in children. Schoolchildren are focused on tests, exams which don’t prepare them for a real life in today's complex world. Bans, discipline, tests, unification of everything. The system is too complicated and archaic. The Ministry of Education is making plans, management is rushing to meet indicators, teachers are swamped with paperwork. Meanwhile, parents earn money for children's education, and children pretend to learn. Such a huge simulation by so many people gives the impression that everything is working. This is an unfair balance.

To change the situation, you need to understand that it has developed and is being reproduced due to the behavior of all parties involved. After all, it benefits everyone. The Ministry of Education reports, teachers are paid, parents fulfill their duty to children, and children are free so they can concentrate on other activities. You don't have to try too hard, think and look for alternatives. Somehow everything is working. Poorly but it is.  

Most of us are not revolutionaries. We play by the established rules, seek to successfully master them and move somewhere. This is the power of social inertia, fed by the silence consent of the majority.

What is the first natural desire? Burn everything to hell, and build a new model of education. Students could be home schooled or attend online courses. The impulse is clear, but the solution is bad because it touches only the surface not the core of the problem.

A true social entrepreneur, must immerse himself in a problem, keep emotions under control and understand the principles which keep the balance stable. If you simply consider your opponents to be obscurants and abyss, you deprive yourself of a huge amount of very important information. Complex systems are always contradictory, so it is so important to dig to the essence of the opposite point of view. Only by understanding someone else's logic you will be able to see effective ways to change it.

Simply negating an unfair balance, often brings in a reverse effect. Those who already are in the system will maintain their status quo as a response to the attacks from the outside. Don't forget, for them it is a natural order, a norm, and your attacks look like provocation or foolishness. But you need these people, because only they have the knowledge which is necessary to understand the essence of equilibrium. The more you communicate with representatives of the system as partners, the better you will understand the causes of the current balance and the conditions that keep it stable.

I often say that a social entrepreneur should first “fall in love” with the problem, or at least respect those with whom he strongly disagrees. It is a hard mindset to achieve, but without due respect you will not take their arguments seriously, your analysis will be weak and the proposed solution will not be optimal. Take the position not of an expert, but of a student, with an unbiased view of the world, who wants to understand the topic. Deep dive into a context will make it possible to see the foundations of the unfair balance.

When you understand the true reasons, you will be able to concentrate all your resources for an accurate strike on them to disrupt the balance and lean the scales to your side.

53,The Change Is Near (read all),"The impending doom we’ve felt is a natural fight or flight response. Because the severity of it is real enough for us to realize it could mean the end to the comfortable lives as we know it. I agree in saying depression nor anxiety help the fight. The most you can do with such a division of the globe and high tensions world wide is to be kind to your neighbor. Lend a helping hand. Spread the word about climate change and ways to reduce your carbon footprint. Small changes do help of course even though the growth of garbage in landfills and the oceans don’t cease; it’ll still be less than if you didn’t make those conscious choices. 

I never asked for this chaotic life style of western civilization. I love the ability to have the ability to have a heated house, sleep in a warm bed, eat fruits and vegetables that don’t originate in this country, etc. But it’s a tough bargain. Without this kind of parasitic world, we would not know a kind and easy lifestyle. The kind of lifestyle we bear is also the very thing that keeps us weak and our minds feeble. Discomfort is where the ability to attain strength lies, comfort will make you soft bodied and even worse soft minded. 

It’s all relative, it depends how you see it. But the facts remain true. We must keep spreading the word, waking people up and getting this world toward a more positive vibe. The old and still minded/ignorant humans will die off and the more educated, conscious ones will remain in their place to fix their mess. It’s all up to us to save our beautiful planet. 

I know, with some everyday is a new battle. You may lose some days, and I’m guilty. Do the best you can. If you’ve taken or are going to take anything from this passage, remember these few things: stay true to your beliefs, spread happiness and love, spread your true word. 

Be the change the world needs, it doesn’t need to be large. We are all but cells on the organism we call earth; if enough of us change for the better, the organism will too. 

Also, most of the population is sick. Don’t follow the crowd, go against it. Don’t let yourself adjust to the sickness of society, for sickness is their norm. Be true to yourself even if you don’t know who you are. 

This wasn’t just about the environment, in short it was about much more. The state of the Earth isn’t the only sickness that needs to be healed. Harness this moment, try to make the best of it. Be true to yourself and my redundancy isn’t mistaken).

54,Numbers on Carbon capture tech,"Hey guys,

I recently read an [article](http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-engineers-develop-new-way-remove-carbon-dioxide-air-1025) where MIT researchers are able to develop low energy intensive carbon capture tech at lab scale. They were able to bring down the energy cost to  1 GJ for 1 tonne of CO2 ( Most existing tech is in the range of 4-10 GJ).

Although commercial scale up feasibility of the tech not tested yet, I took that energy cost as reference and calculated energy needed for CCS to absorb entire current emissions of US as a percentage of their current total energy consumption. For the calcs, I assumed 300 GJ per capita consumption, 330 million population and 5 billion tonnes of emissions. It turns out that to capture entire US emissions, CCS energy cost is only 5 percent of their current total energy consumption! ( 5 billion GJ out of 99 billion GJ) This number sounds too good to be true, am I missing anything?

If this number is true, US can easily allocate  5 percent of their annual energy cost to carbon capture. Maybe another 2-3 percent needed for pipelining and storage. I have been very skeptical of CCS, but now it looks very feasible with these numbers.",sustainability,1574193044

62,A common misunderstanding which needs addressing : Tree planting and carbon,"You will often see comments regarding tree planting, as a solution for carbon removal, being criticized with a deep misunderstanding.

The criticism being thrown around is that the tree will release all the carbon back into the atmosphere once it decomposes and that growing trees is therefore not a valid way of permanently removing and storing carbon.  The follow up ideas are quite ridiculous. ""We need cut the trees down and bury them, deep in the earth, after they are grown""...etc

The idea with planting trees is to extend the existing forest biomes, and bring them closer to the original size they were before humans clear-cut them for lumber.   

The best way to think of it is that any square acre of forest always has a certain amount of organic life in it.  The forest canopy, the understorey, the shrub layer, the forest floor and the soil all store carbon.  When a tree,a shrub, or a mushroom die, they release carbon back into the atmosphere, but they also make space for more life.  You could say that a certain amount of carbon is always locked into the net cycle of life/lives within that square acre.  The same would not be true if it was a parking lot.

Of course, it's not only about forests.  The same is true for all the different biomes.",sustainability,1561975217

65,‘Cement’ing endeavours is a must for ‘Sustainable Construction’," 

THE term ‘Sustainable Construction’ emerges very often during usual Sustainability conversation but this key concept despite being the cornerstone for green infrastructure has not gained as much importance as it was anticipated. With fast growing urbanisation across India, the building activities have been witnessing rapid growth momentum, so does the strain on the finite natural resources.

It is true that expanding urban boundaries have also opened up better opportunities and promising future, thus further driving migration of rural communities to semi or urban cities, but at the same time the unplanned cities have been, it is a proven fact, increasingly triggering environmental degradation. The forest cover has been pruned or compromised while animals inhibited by toxic substances, vehicles and the loss of habitat and food sources…

Therefore, mounting voices all over the country have been demanding immediate corrective actions as well as implementation of more effective long-term policies in this transition to a low-carbon economy, strongly backed by the determined lawmakers as well as big corporations that wield immense money power and have their footprints in remote locations. The later can significantly influence communities around their operations. In addition, robust guidelines by the prominently recognised institutions like NITI Aayog in India as well as the United Nations and World Sustainable Development Associations in the global level will give impetus to undertake adequate remedial measures that safeguard Mother Earth from facing catastrophes like the one that caused destruction in Kerala – the biggest ever in the recent history of God’s own state.

To proactively preserve the environment from gradual degradation, a significant role is being played by the building material sector – along with other core industries – by doing whatever possible. However, this industry and its allied sectors like real estate have been criticised as among the greenhouse polluters. For instance, the country’s apex court Supreme Court has, in its recent interim order, has imposed a ban on construction activities in three biggest markets – Madhya Pradesh, Maharshtra and Uttarakhand – over the delayed framework by the state governments over solid waste management. While this has sparked much turbulence in the relevant sectors, fortunately it was lifted within days. Furthermore, recently the Delhi government too took cognisance of severe environmental impact on the national capital, partly blaming the construction activities.

The environment researchers reiterate the planet’s health will deteriorate even further unless a stronger platform for dialogue and collective action is not brought to the forefront to leverage existing capabilities, that too on a larger scope and scale. The efforts in this direction will accelerate low carbon transition at the time when the government is spending hugely in infrastructure projects – Housing for All, Smart Cities, Highways and Roads among others.

Therefore, much emphasis is given to the resilient green infrastructure that effectively addresses socioeconomic and environmental challenges by integrating holistic approaches leading to a conducive environment where economic indicators, social equity, consumption of energy and natural resources, and rapid advancements in technology thrive together. Emulating practices of global smart cities – Tokyo, Toronto, Seoul, Hong Kong, Amsterdam among others – is a good idea.

But over the years, the building material suppliers – particularly cement sector – have strictly adhered to and embodied the globally benchmarked Sustainable Practices that drove the Sustainable Construction, which has, as a result, been gaining momentum to promote and support green buildings that focused on mitigating both usage of natural resources as well as Green House Gases’ emissions. Their presence in rural and semi-urban regions owing to their nature of business has transformed the surroundings around its operations, generating livelihood and preserving the natural environment while balancing the sustained growth. In fact, India is among the countries that are on track to achieve the targets set to address climate change under the Paris Agreement.

The sector is adopting various practices to address alarming climate change issue – from innovative manufacturing processes that include optimising the extracted key ingredient limestone, advanced kiln mechanism, to energy utilisation and producing blended cement to offering value-added services including advanced concrete curing methodology and innovative rainwater harvesting solutions among others. Extending their efforts in this endeavours are the building architectures who are designing techniques including natural ventilation, double-paned windows, low-flow toilets and low-water-use landscaping etc – all enabling comfortable and improved inhabitants’ lives.

This gradual transition towards green and eco-friendly operations should be encouraged through a range of incentives, including tax breaks, or the prestigious certificates by the government. Involving a diverse set of stakeholders by the government to help improve sustainability scores while enhancing the value creation to the end users, besides enhancing awareness among all will surely deliver desired outcomes.

In conclusion, the low-carbon transition is a continuous journey. Mere implementation of the latest processes, technologies and government reforms may not completely minimise the scale and impact of climate change. However, things can be transformed gradually only by collective and sustained efforts towards climate-resilient emissions’ control strategies.

The lack of prompt is impeding me more than I expected and I can't seem to choose one topic to write about. 

Some of the things we have discussed in class are the effects of the industrial revolution, what historical events have allowed for capitalism to flourish, what greenwashing is and examples of it, why people don't care about the environment, how humans try to separate themselves from nature and why, and what the future holds.

I'm open to things like ""write about why plastic bags are so horrible and a solution, like a ban, or consumers having to bring their own"", etc., but this class has kind of opened my eyes to the dystopia we're living in and I feel so hopeless about it that those type of solutions seem a bit fruitless. I'm more interested in the relationship between humans and nonhumans and how we treat them/separate ourselves from them, but that has to connect back to sustainability. I'm also interested in the primitive anthropology of humans and how we ended up where we are today.

71,Persuasion for humanity,"&gt; Not all advertising has to be evil 

Wanting to share your beliefs without imposing on the freedom of others

### The healthy option

Compromising on one's values can slowly eat away at their sense of self, their confidence and their ability not to compromise in future situations. Perhaps this is contributing to global cases of mental health problems, in that we deep down can understand the effects of habitat destruction, but continue to compromise and consume the products which destroy it.

Maybe you've come to realise this, you're now less stressed, confident in yourself and living in a way you believe is beneficial to others. 

But, what about your friend? Your family? The rest of the world? You want to help them to feel good about themselves, conserve our shared environment and help others. What's stopping you?

### Don't tell me what to think!

I know I've never appreciated people telling me what to think, let alone what to believe. I imagine most people are the same.

Recently, I encountered a person who, after a minute of chit chat, started to tell me I must believe in Jesus and pray for us all, then proceeded on a 20-minute one-way conversation about aliens, Beyonce, reptillian people and other interesting, though unlikely, theories, such as the Large Hadron Collider being used to open a portal to the demonic underworld. 

Whilst a little alarming, I wasn't otherwise indisposed, so it was interesting to experience this person, so excited about their beliefs. 20 mins was enough though, so to much relief, after they left, my flatmate and I had a chat about it. We're not the sort of people to say they shouldn't have believed in what they did, but felt that if their intent was to convert me to their way of thinking, her approach was ineffective.

So, how could this person have better tried to persuade me to her beliefs?

### Selling what people want

Using words like selling and advertising still make me feel a little dirty. I think because I see so much of it out there that I feel is against the common interest for humanity. But, if this is the prevalent system able to convince the masses to believe they want *product X*, then should we not consider leveraging it to promote what we believe in?

TV advertising sounds a little out of date now, but before the internet's dominance, this was a key way for advertisers to sell to the audience. At least in the United States, some brodcasters used to be required to air some quantity of Public Service Announcements (PSAs). And these usually ended up being broadcast in the times with the least amount of viewers. Because - money.

### Financial reasons

What is the reason we aren't all working for Greenpeace or sharing the harvesting on a kibbutz? Is it our belief that we need an ever unattainable amount of money? Is that why we compromised and took the job with McBurgers. Maybe we believed it was just a temporary gig, so we could just get to a future state where we can live true to our beliefs? 

Naomi Klein's ""No Logo"" describes the big brand companies becoming ""lifestyle companies"", selling the companies image not only to the consumers, but also to their staff. Perhaps with enough colorful t-shirts, social mixers and corporate social responsibility projects, it is possible to keep staff content with not only some money, but also a belief that their sweatshop made products and hip software is for the common good. It did take me many years to walk away from the money (the belief in the products rarely lasted through the interview). I still earn a little from such a gig due to some of that self-compromising already mentioned, but with a clear plan to escape.

### Telling friends what they don't want to hear

With friends, we have a bit more room to tell them what we think is good for them, that they wouldn't likely accept from a complete stranger. A bit more room, but not a carte blanche to force your beliefs on them.

So, your friend wants to buy a new gadget/car/muscial toothbrush. You want them to not want to do that. How could this be achieved?

 - telling them they're wrong and an evil person
 - giving them your gadget/car/musical toothbrush
 - do nothing and compromise a little more of yourself
 - educating them that their freedom to buy it has a real cost/impact on other people's freedoms

The last one sounds great, but is not an easy task. I've used the example of a friend, but this applies to your small tribe of family and social peers as well as to the greater and global community you live in. You don't want to be unfriended by the world, do you? Better to be wrong and have friends than the be the only sane person who lives alone in a cave.

Just as killing someone who opposes what you believe in is an extreme reaction, so is doing nothing at all. Let's find somewhere around the middle of that dark-bright divide which is yin yang. 

### Same mistakes, bigger consequences

Persuading people has been in our toolkit ever since we didn't want to keep killing the guy standing between us and the watering hole. Historical records of it go back as far as 2285 BC. 

Once developed, one can use it for the benefit of others or for their own selfish goals, depending on which way their moral compass is being blown by the spiritual winds.

Not much has changed in human behaviour since those early days of rhetoric, but the world we live in and our depletion of the life sustaining resources in it may now require those with a belief in sustaining life to up their powers of persuasion.

Even if we achieve this great raising of awareness amongst humanity the day before a great meteor wipes us out, we'll at least have had that one day of beauty.",sustainability,1496364068
72,Advice for Design/Architecture with a strong sustainability Focus?,"TL;DR at bottom.

I'd like to get into design in sort of a broad sense, in the general realm of industrial design/architecture/urban planning, for sustainability/climate change efforts/environmental etc. I didn't know anything about these fields until recently, and am concerned it's too late for me (now 29, with a language BA and part of a film MFA). I've been working as a translator, being indecisive about what I want to do, feeling pulled in many directions. 

I feel a weird indescribable ""call"" to something in this general field of disciplines that I can't properly explain, which I've been ignoring for several years outside of a few small personal projects I've done. The vagueness of this post is, in part, me trying to figure out what's going on with that. To that end, does anyone have any ideas about what the best course for me might be? Either in terms of education or job prospects? What's out there? 

Might anyone have any resources for me for organizations, firms, etc. involved in these fields that have a very strong green bent, or a multidisciplinary approach, or are trying to lead the way in innovation or conceptual experimentation (I recognize this is vague and kind of silly sounding, I'm just trying to test the boundaries of the disciplines and see if there's stuff I haven't seen)? 

Are there any sorts of apprenticeships or internships I could do with no real experience to just figure out what I'm looking for?

Are Masters in any of these fields worth anything without a prior Bachelor's degree or a really solid research objective? Can they ""substitute"" for a Bachelor's at all, in the sense of being like a Bachelor's with all the gen ed and elective courses removed? I've seen some conflicting opinions on the subreddits for the above-mentioned fields. I've also seen here and there that degrees focusing on sustainability in a general sense (which may have tracks oriented towards the disciplines I'm talking about, or an integrated, non-specialist approach) are kind of wishy-washy, how true is that?

TL;DR: I'm youngish but getting kind of old for a total career change given my paucity of experience, but I feel an inexplicable call towards working in the design of our material environments as a means of getting involved in sustainability efforts that is getting increasingly difficult for me to ignore. I'm having a hard time getting a solid handle on what's out there and if school is a good idea or not. Help?

75,Sustainability Storytelling: The Wooden Monkey,"Without even knowing it, people who go eat at The Wooden Monkey, do good to their entire community and economy. This exceptional restaurant is located in the beautiful and historic capital of Nova Scotia, which is where I attended university.  For four years I discovered its hills, pubs, music, art, culture, restaurants and its famous +Halifax Seaport Farmers' Market. 

It was actually near the end of my degree that I discovered the true and incredible story of this restaurant and its significance to many local farmers’ lives. +Mount Saint Vincent University hosted an Entrepreneur Business Conference, which I attended. The founder of The Wooden Monkey, Lil MacPherson, was there to talk about her experience with starting her own business and the reasons behind her initiative.  

During her presentation, which was filled with excitement and passion, I found out that the restaurant was cooking creative meals with only organic and local resources. In other words, this restaurant supports as many organic and local farms as they can by purchasing their meats, fish, dairy and vegetables- directly from them. That means fair prices for both parties and first-name-basis business relationships, which won’t be rivalled by your ‘local’ box store or fast food chain anytime soon. As of today, they have 18 suppliers, and every Saturday their chef heads to the Farmer’s Market to get as many of supplies as they can to be used for the week. 

That being said, if there’s no more chicken in their kitchen they will not serve it until their suppliers bring them more! Most of the restaurants I know would send someone to the closest supermarket immediately, but that’s not what The Wooden Monkey stands for. Eating locally means being okay with what you’ve got at that time of year. Customers are clearly supporting this concept, as it’s one of the most respected and popular restaurant’s in the region. 

The Wooden Monkey even goes beyond regular soft drinks- they serve locally-made root beer and other sodas, real Nova Scotia cranberry, blueberry and apple juice and homemade lemonade. Organic grains, flours, raisins, vegetables, (you name it), are used. Microwaves and deep fryers are non-existent in the restaurant AND it’s cleaned only with environment-friendly cleaning products. To top it off, takeaway cups and containers are given to customers only by request- and they’re biodegradable. 

This isn’t just a business, it’s a movement. On their website you’ll see recommended readings for a more sustainable lifestyle, approved documentaries, environmental action community events and features of the restaurant’s commitments. It’s truly become a community that shines with happiness through their actions and lifestyle. 

The incredible dedication to running this green machine started after the massive Hurricane Juan hit Nova Scotia in 2003. Winds as high as 157km/h were recorded and left behind a significantly damaged city. Roads and stores were closes, making supplies small and difficult to get, even in a developed country - imagine that. 

Necessity is the mother of invention. This proverb was true for Lil MacPherson. She worried during the waiting time and stillness of the province, as help from the Canadian government was arriving. As she explains on her website, it was worrisome to think we depended on suppliers so far from our own land to provide food for us, especially when we live on such resourceful land. She asked herself:

•	Do we have enough food in N.S. to feed everyone if we were ever shut off from the rest of the world for a few days or even weeks?
•	How much do we depend on the outside world to bring us our food supply every day?
•	How many farmers do we have?
•	How resourceful are we?

From there, she partnered up with Christine Bower, and took the initiative to start this farm-to-table restaurant. It was created from the very need to go back to our resources. 

The Wooden Monkey team is showing its customers how sustainable agriculture done by small organic farmers is the most positive way to live. A wonderful bonus for the sustainability cravers: most of the material used to build the restaurant was recovered wood from barns, buildings, and trees that were blown down from Hurricane Juan. 

Recently, they built a second location in the city next door, Dartmouth, with their newest partner; Matthew Gass. The journey continues on, who knows how many Maritimers this business has inspired and helped to flourish as food producers, ethical eaters, and local food connoisseurs. If you are visiting the area, just moved there, or already live in Halifax but have never been, I strongly recommend you go and experience the incredible food this team of locals, or should I say community, is creating!

78,Conscious Cosmos Tour,"So for the last couple weeks we have been enduring an immense amount of stress. As we began drawing nearer and nearer to our departure date, things began falling apart. From past experience we knew that when trying to accomplish any feat, they must do three things. First one must dream, aspire to see their situation from an out of your body view point. Meditate on your idea and visualize it as a 3d map. One that on a whim, you may dive into the deepest darkest caverns, or climb to the highest heights. Allow your ego to vanish, close your eyes and open your mind. You would be amazed at what's in there! One must first see reality as your spirit does, limitless. Second, one must manifest. Once you have a strong visual, comprehensible model of the challenge ahead, only then are you able breath life into it. Speak it, live it, love it. No matter what always reside in the light. When it comes to negativity it can only harm your chances of success. Even though it may be difficult, one must manifest the most positive scenario possible. Even if you fake it. The positive energy you put out into the universe, results in positive energy returned. The negative energy that you inflict will come back to haunt you. The more positive energy the better the reality.
The last thing that anyone must do to obtain their dreams through manifestation is to put all the faith you can muster into yourself, but more importantly the universe. There is a universal consciousness that we are all residing in. We are but spirits temporarily inhabiting a physical form. We are infinite beings of light and dark, yin and yang, a duality within the very fabric of existence that we call reality. There is a purpose and path for every single molecule, that makes up us and the rest of the forever expanding cosmos. We all work together to make the gears turn, for,  we are all one. So anything you dream, speak, or do affects the entirety of our world, and the next, and the next. Dream with a passion in your heart, and a vision of a better future. manifest a productive, and positive energy from inside yourself that will alter this plane and the next, and have faith, trust that love and light will prevail. 
Now, all this may be true, but, it is most definitely not a simple task. In our world it seems as if these lessons and codes to live by are the answer to living a successful life, and they are, but its often that we are tested, thrown every possible curve ball that comes our way, and lots of times it is extremely difficult to walk the walk. I believe this and this alone is what keeps us walking. What keeps our faith. For when we are challenged we are shown our weaknesses. Our weaknesses as individuals, as partners, and as parents. When you have such a outstanding, and life changing thing happen in your life, in our case, the arrival of our daughter Willow, your mind body and spirit all go through a significant change in a relatively short amount of time. Willow has began to teach us how to be better humans. She is teaching us to be better partners. She is our catalyst for being the best parents we can be. The universe has granted us the gift of a life to look after, a love we never would have known, and a chance to change the world for the better. Which brings me to our way of accomplishing just that. Today we have departed on a great journey, one that takes us cross country, in our school bus tiny home, with our 4 months old daughter, focusing on reducing our footprint and educating others on living sustaiably. As well as providing a model for other families with children a way to live nomadically,  with a child, while still being the change we wish to see in the world.  We aim to focus on outreach for homeless youth. Our dream is to create sustainable living care packages, which would include MREs, solar chargers, hand crank flashlights, and a simple water filtration bottles. We are manifesting your help!

0,carbon offsets seem too cheap to be realistic.,"I calculated my CO2 emissions per year at 2.9 tons on wren.com website.

This so far seems accurate as I am not connected to the power grid or any utilities, and I don't ride in cars, planes, buses or anything with an engine in it.  I catch rain, compost my poo, cook using solar oven and wood.

The problem is, they claim for $4 a month I can completely offset this 2.9 ton of emissions.   This is obviously a lie/scam/fake.  If it were true we could offset all of america (more than 6x my emissions on average) for 100 billion a year.   If it were really this cheap we could really afford to simply offset the entire world and be done with the whole issue.

So,  why are they allowed to lie/scam people and take their money while not actually burying carbon in a stable form?    Why do they not calculate the emissions of refining, and transporting the fuels and all the energy used to produce an aircraft such as exotic super alloys in the engine.   All the emissions of all the people who work at airports (could be eliminated) as well as everything involved with that.

   They only consider the emissions it burns in that one flight, don't consider the effects of releasing it at high altitude, and in the end offer ""offsets"" by selling co2 to greenhouses or  planting trees that will eventually (or maybe next year even) burn down in uncontrollable forest fires.

&amp;#x200B;

So where can you buy real offsets?   I am guessing the real thing doesn't exist: I would have to make charcoal and go bury it in an abandoned mine or something.",climatechange,1643095153

At this point it seems as if we are experiencing one of the first existential threats that being Climate change. Climate change happening and there being irreversible damage done to the planet seems inevitable at this point with world leaders and corporate giants telling average citizens to improve there carbon foot print which is true.

But this is a very obvious shift in blame from these officials as the laws the governments pass out right go against what climate experts recommend so that large corperations can process there product as fast as possible.

2,"The current faces of denial: Deception, deflection and defeatism.","While people who outright deny climate change do certainly still exist, they are now in the minority. The majority now recognises the simple fact that climate change is a real and present threat to Humanity, and that it needs to be addressed.

As such the fossil fuel corporations, who have been spreading propaganda for years as I'm sure most of you already know, have been forced to move onto more insidious forms of denial.

1) Deception:

Deceiving people with greenwashing and fantasy technologies. We can see numerous infuriating examples of this, particularly in companies that use 'carbon capture' and geoengineering as excuses to continue burning destructive and finite fuel sources.

2) Deflection:

Transfering the blame onto others, when they are the core of the rot. The most well known form of this is the whole CaRbOn FoOtPrInT lie that major companies came up with to push individual, rather than collective, action. We can also see this with people who say things like ""Why should my country lower emissions? It's India/China/Russia/America/etc that are to blame!""

If we blame each other to excuse inaction, while ignoring the true people at the core of this catastrophe, we will never get anything done. We need unified action if we are to come out of this crisis, we cannot achieve that if we are shifting blame around endlessly.

3) Defeatism:

This is not as common as the others, but it is perhaps the most insidious. In the face of increasingly disastrous climate change we can also observe an increase in doomism and fatalism within the environmental movement itself- something that is believed to be spurred, ironically enough, by the fossil fuel companies and their bots. Even just looking around this subreddit and others like it you'll see people popping up in any discussion about climate actions or realistic solutions to preach about how 'it's already too late' or else that 'tipping points will wipe us out in a few years so it's pointless anyway'.

I empathise with this mentality because I've been there. And, unlike other forms of denial, there is some truth to it: It is too late to stop climate change and biodiversity loss, because it's already here and will continue to worsen in the near term even if we do everything right.

Having said that this also ignores the fact that climate change is not a binary situation: It's not something that will or won't happen, it's already happened and now it's a matter of how much worse we let it get. If we fail to contain global warming to 2.0 degrees C then 2.5 is better than 3.6, which is better than 4.0, which is better than, 5.0 degrees, etc. How bad it gets is up to us as a global civilisation- and yes, that is including positive feedback loops. Contrary to popular opinion most tipping points, as per our present understanding, function over an extended period of time- with some possible exponential shifts in the more extreme ones.

That is not to say that they aren't a massive threat, because they are. It is simply to say that they are long-term threats that lock in climate change for years even after we stop emitting, rather than instantaneous threats that will knock us into a Day After Tomorrow type scenario as soon as we trigger them. Even if that was true it still wouldn't account for plastic waste, chemical pollution nor habitat destruction by the agricultural industry (particularly the beef industry) which are all purely Human errors and can be stopped by Humans.

**So, what can we do?**

First, we need the mental resilience not to give up in the face of an ever more dire situation. Things are bad and they will likely get worse, we need to accept that so we can mitigate and adapt to it as it comes. We need a massive and unified movement to change our society for the better; that can only happen if we are willing to stand together in holding the rich suits who caused this mess and forced us into a consumerist system to account.

Lifestyle changes are good and should be encouraged, but the best thing you can do is become part of the social shift we are presently seeing. Volunteer with local conservation groups, join an activist organisation, go on strike, plant pollinator friendly plants, combat the various forms of denial when you see them, write to your representatives, vote on politicians based on actions rather than parties, try to rally your community in building resilience to climate change (Establishing communal permaculture gardens, planting native trees, writing to the government enmasse, etc) and donate to trustworthy charities- if you can afford it.

On a societal level we need to focus on not just transitioning away from fossil fuels but also on cooling down the planet. Enhancing natural carbon sinks, particularly ocean ones, through rewilding and most likely a degree of genetic modification is vital for this.

Do not let people guilt trip you, do not let them lie to you about false-hope silver bullets and do not let them convince you that it is too late to do anything at all. The elites will brutalise our planet then profit off of our suffering if we let them; But Humanity is capable of both horrific and wonderful things when we work together.",climatechange,1642895387
3,"How would the world look like ""after"" climate change?","I know this may be a stupid question, but I'm still curious. So let's say climate change runs its course and we've come to the point where pretty much all of the foreboded changes to our planet came into reality. What would our world look like?

Provided that average temperatures will ever eventually stabilize (IIRC, they would?), what would they stabilize at? And what would various places in the world look like?
Sure the North Pole would wholly melt and become accessible for commercial uses, many areas would be flooded by higher sea levels, deserts would spread and I've also heard that Siberia would become lush, temperate farmland. However, I don't know much more nor anything in detail. What places would be temperate, cold, arid, etc.? What places would be inhabitable vs. uninhabitable? Where would most people migrate to and which places would have to be surrendered to the sea? (as in no dams are built and the areas are just abandoned)

Like I said: a, realistically plausible post-climate-change world. What's it like? Has there been much thinking about that? I've heard about the scaremongering how the world would end, but that's obviously not true. A sense of normalcy would, of course, inevitably return eventually and I'm curious what it would be like",climatechange,1641912423

Does someone with more expertise or more research comment on this comment?",climatechange,1641390922
5,Will the correlation between the atmospheric CO2 level and the average global temperature soon start to fall apart?,"When I look at graphs comparing atmospheric CO2 concentration and global average temperature, such as this one: [https://johnenglander.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CO2-Temperature%20420%20kyr.gif](https://johnenglander.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CO2-Temperature%20420%20kyr.gif) , I see a very obvious relationship that spans across past millennia. However, I also see that the trends in CO2 concentration tend to follow that of the temperature. In other words, higher or lower temperatures seem to cause higher or lower amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere, and not the other way around. This is contrary to the mainstream narrative of anthropogenic global warming. This is especially apparent in how drops in the CO2 level tend to lag drops in temperature, often by many centuries.

One explanation given is that the oceans have historically been the greatest contributor to atmospheric CO2. Higher ocean temperatures mean they release more CO2 into the atmosphere, and lower ocean temperatures mean that they are better at absorbing it. Since the oceans are so big and it can take a very long time to either heat or cool them compared to the air and the land, this could explain the lag in the relationship.

The atmospheric CO2 level has shot up since the start of the Industrial Revolution. This unnatural increase is apparent at the far right end of the graph I linked to above. Supposedly, the atmospheric CO2 concentration today is the highest it's been in almost a million years. That may well be true, and it seems obvious to me that a lot of the recent increase has been due to human activity. But if CO2 emissions (whether natural or man-made) don't actually contribute to higher temperatures, but are merely a symptom of it, then we shouldn't expect the global average temperature to follow the same curve. The world may suddenly start to cool from other causes (such as quieting solar activity, changes in Earth's orbit, less heat being transferred from the Earth's core, or some other forces that are still poorly understood) and yet the atmospheric CO2 level may keep rising from fossil fuel emissions regardless. Alternatively, these or other natural forces could keep global temperatures rising even as human civilization abandons fossil fuels and uses cleaner sources of energy (such as space-based solar power, which I see as being in our future).

Even within the short time span that human industrial activity has massively contributed to CO2 emissions, I see important clues that it's not the cause for the recent global warming. Here's a graph showing the average global temperature and the atmospheric CO2 concentration over the past 150 years: [https://www.globalchange.gov/sites/globalchange/files/styles/resource\_image/http/data.globalchange.gov/assets/22/05/f91f3e0f9de762a469592dc44804/CS\_global\_temp\_and\_co2\_1880-2012\_V3.png?itok=\_eLJDZSz](https://www.globalchange.gov/sites/globalchange/files/styles/resource_image/http/data.globalchange.gov/assets/22/05/f91f3e0f9de762a469592dc44804/CS_global_temp_and_co2_1880-2012_V3.png?itok=_eLJDZSz) Notice that between roughly 1940 and 1975, the global average temperature wasn't rising, and even dipped slightly. In the 1970's, many scientists and the mainstream media were warning of an impending ice age based on the previous few decades of data. Yet during this period, the atmospheric CO2 level began to rise precipitously, likely due to the post-war industrial boom. Also notice that, between roughly 1910 and 1940, the rate of the global average temperature increase was about the same (if not more) than the rate of increase between 1975 and the present. But the atmospheric CO2 level was only gradually increasing during the former period, as human industrial activity was not yet widespread.

So in conclusion, I think that there historically really was a relationship between atmospheric CO2 concentration and the average global temperature, but the relationship was the inverse of what the mainstream narrative has led most to believe. Do you think, now that human activity contributes a significant chunk to CO2 emissions, and that temperature changes are likely due to unrelated causes, that the relationship between the two could soon fall apart?",climatechange,1640702113

 The National Green Tribunal on Friday, December 10, stayed the felling of trees at Auroville, which has been tense over the past few days, after the Auroville Foundation and Town Development Council (TDC) brought in earthmovers and cleared a few meters for laying a road for the Crown project of the foundation. The NGT has posted the matter for further hearing on December 17. The NGT admitted the petition against the felling of trees, saying that ""we are satisfied that there arises a substantial question of environment,"" as to whether any permission is required the law for cutting trees from an area which can be treated as a ‘Deemed Forest.’ The NGT has issued a notice to Auroville Foundation to file its response to the petition.  

 

""We feel that the status-quo order can be passed directing the 1st respondent- Auroville Foundation not to fell any further trees till 17.12.2021 as no much damage will be caused to the other side if it is stopped for a short while in the interest of protecting environment,"" the NGT said in its order on Friday.

The project targets to implement four zones — industrial, cultural, residential and recreational — which will go out of the Matrmandir, the centre of Auroville which was established in 1968 for universal peace. People from across the globe stay in the township floated by the Auroville Foundation in Villupuram.

 The Auroville Resident Assembly is of the opinion that they were not blocking development, instead they were requesting for the community process to be followed. A Resident Assembly member told IANS: ""We generally make decisions as a community through a process and this decision is approved by the Resident Assembly. Here the Auroville Foundation has not followed this process and is charging that we are blocking development which is not true.""

 Some members of the Resident Assembly had alleged that some members in the Auroville Foundation were adamant to implement their decision which was not approved by the Resident Assembly. The residents say that the Foundation and the TDC had brought in earthmovers to cut and remove the trees which were blocked by the residents but at 1 am, the TDC and Auroville Foundation came and created a scene with the police.

9,THE GREAT EXISTENTIAL THREAT,"  

I’ll make this as brief as possible. To offer some form of explanation in terms of the millennial generation offering some form of explanation to those of Generation Z and those currently protesting and becoming climate change activists.

I would state that my activities in this endeavor started in 2008. I was working as a barback in Melbourne’s CBD. I was working up to 32 hours over the weekend and studying fulltime doing a bachelor’s degree at university.

One weekend my father was taking a business trip to Canberra, the Australian Capital Territory. I had a friend who was living in the city so I thought I would tag along. I didn’t have enough money for a hotel or anything like that. So I spent the time sleeping in the car until I could get in touch with my friend. It was freezing as I slept in the car. I started to think on the different things that I could do in the ACT with limited funds. I went to the national library and wrote a short metaphorical piece.

The piece described a situation where we had been invaded by aliens and they had given us the technology to pollute our own atmosphere and thus render the human race extinct through the pollution of their own environment. The next day I visited my friend and was able to print out about a hundred copies of the metaphorical/hypothetical scenario in which aliens had given us the technology to destroy ourselves. I then went around Canberra and posted up the pieces of paper around the place. It had the political motivation of promoting clean energy. Though in retrospect, it was probably adding to the pollution in printing out the 100 flyers. But no more than advertising for the latest pizza deal.

I did that in 2008. When Labor was in power and the Greens were pushing for more action on the subject here in Australia. Because when it comes down to it… It is an existential threat. I would consider that most people are like the ostrich with it’s head stuck in the sand on the issue. They ignore the reality of the situation and just hope it will go away. There’s plenty of issues like this that work in human psychology. People just hope that it will go away… They physically do not have the nerves to face the reality of the scenario.

So the reality of human psychology when it comes down to climate change is a fragmented one. People outright deny the realistic implications of this issue and claim some sort of conspiracy when it comes to the great environmental crisis that lies ahead of us all. We’re closing on the world population of 8 billion now. And because of COVID there seems to be some delusion that we have to repopulate the numbers lost.

That’s more birds with their head in the sand. A lot of the world leaders who are currently in power were attempting to do something about the issue. They were placing economic restrictions on the people so that they would control breeding of the population. The problem with this, of course, is that only those people in line with reality would pay any attention to what they can and cannot afford in terms of raising children of their own. And I would think that the world leaders, even they, with their dismal attitudes would be astonished at the general lack of reason that takes place on this planet. The world’s population continues to rise.

So we’re all living in some sort of fragmented reality. People simply do not want to face the vast implications that climate change and all facts relating to this planet describe. Those end of world movies… They’re not describing a fictional event. I don’t think they remain a true account of what will happen. But as writers and imaginers our minds run wild with the prospect of all the calamities that we’re facing on this planet. 

The protests describe the G20 summit as a failure. Claiming that it’s business as usual. I wouldn’t be so much pointing the finger at these people. I would have the world’s population start taking accountability for their own actions. Protests turn into something much akin to rock concerts. People buying food and holding up signs. ‘Business as usual’ means something different when we look to how many countries left the Paris agreement recently. They’re all returning to a semi-dislocated plan. The transition would start at individual accountability. However, when people bring up that term they usually point to the person sitting next to them and state that they’re the problem. The truth is we’re all the problem. And until we realize that, the world will continue to spiral out of control.

8 BILLION PEOPLE! Think about that… If you’re planning on having kids or living a normal life. Think again. And those 8 BILLION PEOPLE are vastly consuming the world’s resources at an epic rate. As a human being we all leave a carbon footprint whether we like it or not. The reality is this message won’t get through to much of anyone. Everyone will continue having children and speeding the world towards a pinnacle of disaster.

Because when we think about personal accountability in this issue. People just think they’re talking about someone else. Human beings are that faulty that I would never prescribe a situation of hope. The only hope that there is in this world with it’s 8 BILLION people is prolonging the inevitable and keeping everything peaceful enough that we don’t just tear ourselves apart.

I imagine the end of the world much like a world that’s consumed all of it’s physical resources. Then those left of us that are sane will all take the pathway of euthanasia. Either that or turn towards cannibalism. 

The truth is those that have confronted this issue are in shock of it all. A lot of us did try to fight the system, but then as we took up positions in the workforce realized that we were the system. It’s not a pretty world or experience. But those of us who are aware are just attempting to minimize the harm they do to themselves and others. The fragmented reality that we face in terms of the environmental crisis is in no short term, ‘apocalyptic’.",climatechange,1636315415
10,Why are China and India not taking climate change seriously when they are some of the most vulnerable to sea level rise?," 

China didn't attend COP26 and isn't taking the necessary strides to reduce greenhouse emissions. India isn't much better. Before you say their per capita emissions are low - this isn't true in practice. A significant portion of the population still live in or close to poverty (in India the vast majority still live in underdeveloped areas, in rural farms and villages); when we only include the proportion of the population who are actually using the energy produced (i.e.: the industrialists/factory owners and wealthy), emissions per person are high and can be expected to increase a worrying amount over the coming years.

Now I understand China and India want to prioritise economic growth over climate considerations, but why? The vast majority of China's population live in low-lying areas, and most of China's industrial complex is on the coast, and is very vulnerable to flooding. Meanwhile for India, some of its largest cities, like Mumbai, Chennai, Calcutta and Visakhapatnam are on the coast and are already seeing the effects of climate change, while much of the north is vulnerable to drought and desertification.

I would understand these countries' attitudes if they weren't very vulnerable to climate change (like Russia), but they are - it seems totally counter to their self interests to care this little. And whether it's ""fair"" or not, the future of the planet largely depends on how Asia tackles energy production now\*.

Why are they not taking the necessary strides to reduce emissions (both countries have the resources and technology to move towards nuclear and hydroelectric) and what can be done to change this?

\*I am not trying to absolve western countries of responsibility here; the US for sure isn't doing nearly enough and its emissions per capita are eye watering, while countries like Germany seem to be going backwards, but for this discussion I would like to talk about the Asian giants",climatechange,1636029100

12,"Rethinking Climate Change: How Humanity Can Choose to Reduce Emissions 90% by 2035 through the Disruption of Energy, Transportation, and Food with Existing Technologies"," 

Technology disruptions already underway in the energy, transportation, and food sectors have extraordinary implications for climate change.

These three disruptions alone, driven by just eight technologies, can directly eliminate over 90% of net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide within 15 years. Market forces can be leveraged to drive the bulk of global GHG emissions mitigation because the technologies required are either already commercially available and competitive today, or can be deployed to market before 2025 with the right societal choices. The same technologies will also make the cost of carbon withdrawal affordable, meaning that moonshot breakthrough technologies are not required to solve the ‘Last Carbon Problem’ and go beyond net zero from 2035 onwards.

Key Findings Key Implications of the Energy, Transportation, and Food Disruptions for Climate Change

1. We can achieve net zero emissions much more quickly than is widely imagined by deploying and scaling the technology we already have.
2. We can achieve net zero emissions without collateral damage to society or the economy.
3. Markets can and must play the dominant role in reducing emissions.
4. Decarbonizing the global economy will not be costly, it will instead save trillions of dollars.
5. A focused approach to reducing emissions is better than an all-of-the-above ‘whack-a-mole’ approach.
6. We no longer need to trade off the environment and the economy against each other.
7. The clean disruption of energy, transportation, and food will narrow rather than widen the gap between wealthy and poor communities, and developed and less-developed countries.
8. The same technologies that allow us to mitigate emissions will also enable us to withdraw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere affordably.
9. Societal choices matter, and technology alone is not enough to achieve net zero emissions.

The Age of Creation

Humanity is on the cusp of the most profound transformation of the system of production in human history; from an extraction-based system dependent on exploiting scarce inputs (resources and labor) that requires scale and reach and centralization; to a creation-based system; a generative model that creates the things we need from super-abundant inputs available everywhere, and that is distributed, interconnected and networked. The complex problems in society, from climate change to conflict and inequality, are an inevitable outcome of this extraction-based system of production. In an extractive system, a ‘growth imperative’ is the key underlying evolutionary driver.

Civilizations that grow their capabilities and reach the fastest, spread through conquest or mimicry. Zero-sum competition forces societies to exploit or be exploited, hardwiring environmental degradation and inequality into the system. Societies that fail to exploit people and the planet slow progress and become footnotes in history. Thus, all these problems are at their root an outcome of our extraction-based system of production. However, society is blind to this critical insight and the possibility of an alternative. Our reductionist, narrow, linear mindsets mean we fail to appreciate the complex processes of change driving the disruption of our production system and are hence unable to recognize the speed, scale and impact of this transformation.

This failure means we see these problems as ‘wicked’ intractable issues with no good solutions. That might be true within the framework of the incumbent system, where zero-sum trade-offs mean that solving climate change for example, impacts economic growth; but this is not the case in the emerging system, that allows us to address all our problems together without trade-offs, as if cutting the Gordian knot.

Unfortunately, conventional blindness to this opportunity compels us to focus our efforts on solving yesterday’s problems, by patching up the old system through ‘Band-Aid’ solutions which address the symptom not the cause. While many of these ‘Band-Aids’ have some use in holding the current system together to prevent collapse before the new system emerges, they must not be mistaken for ‘cures’. Other ‘Band-Aids,’ however, can divert valuable resources (time, attention and capital) away from the optimal interventions and even risk shutting off the route to breakthrough.

The impending transformation of the production system driven by disruptions across the five foundational sectors of civilization represents a phase change: a fundamental change to the system state where all the conditions, rules and relationships are re-configured. This system thus cannot be understood through our existing mindsets, nor governed by our existing organizing system. This is why disruption comes from the edge. The greater the expertise of the current system, the more there is to unlearn. The advantage of incumbency will become the baggage of incumbency.

Only by relinquishing our reductionist mindsets and embracing a lens built on complexity and holism can we hope to identify the root cause of our problems and seize the extraordinary opportunities emerging allowing us to avoid catastrophic risks. Our hope is that this work will help reframe debates across society and help us recognize the possibilities of a new system.

If we can learn to see the world through a broader, clearer lens, we can properly diagnose our problems so that we can prescribe the right medicine, and avoid making decisions that waste valuable resources on misguided interventions.

I do most things a 16 year old can do. I recycle. I turn things off at the mains. I try to buy plastic free, and lots more will become available to me as I get older, for sure, but, for the moment, I’ve always had this thought at the back of my mind. Am I part of the problem? Do I contribute to something i’m against? Am I a bad person because of it? For years, I’ve been thinking the answer to that is yes. The reason? I’m a trainspotter, have been for most of my life. It’s no secret that trains emmit, at least the ones that run near me, and, it’s gotten to the point when I can’t just leave them behind, they’re too precious to me. Same as F1. I’m an F1 fan, have been for years, and if I walked out it would take a toll on me. And even if I did, carbon would still be emmitted. Just because I walk out, doesn’t mean it’ll stop, but, that prompts my brain to say that i’m part of the problem, betraying a cause I believe in, a climate denier scum in disguise. That’s the kind of stuff my brain gors to when I think about this stuff, so, in truth, is what my brain says true? I admit, railways are being electrified, F1 is switching to biofuels in the very near future, but, it doesn’t matter. I could live 100% carbon free, but i’d still think i’m the problem.

TLDR: I care about the climate, but i like stuff that emmits. Am i a bad person?

Thanks all…",climatechange,1633299032
14,Climate Change and Commodity Trading,"La Nina is coming back but not all La Ninas are the same. Some are stronger than others and certain teleconnections such as solar activity, ocean temperatures need west Africa and many other factors can influence commodities and crops thousands of miles away. CLIMATE CHANGE and deforestation can often offset the implications of La Nina and El Nino.

There are different types of La Nina and confusion that all La Ninas result in lower global coffee crops. This is not true and last year's La Nina event was unusual. Weak La Nina events, coupled with Brazil deforestation can result in disasters to Brazil coffee crops (like last year), but strong La Ninas actually affect crops further south in South America like corn and soybeans and do not directly correlate to droughts for Brazil coffee. It is also important to monitor something we call the Tropical South Atlantic (TSA) Index--ocean temperatures along the equator and near west Africa in the Atlantic. A positive (warm) TSA could help feed the jetstream and bring rains to drought areas, while a negative TSA (cool) can exacerbate droughts.

La Ninas and Climate Change can definitely affect corn, sugar, and soybean crops in southern South America and might ignite a bull market later this year and in 2022. With the stock market not going on forever, there are opportunities to trade commodity ETFs based on Climate Change.

&amp;#x200B;

Strong La Nina events can lower Central America or Colombia coffee crops due to too much rain and flooding (IE 2010-2012 La Nina). El Nino can lower both Vietnam and northern Brazil coffee production with hot dry weather (IE 2014-2015)--both major spikes in both Robusta and Arabica coffee prices.

I invite you to read some old articles I wrote here in [Weather Wealth](https://www.bestweatherinc.com/commodities/weather-wealth-how-to-use-weather-to-invest-in-commodities/) last summer and how the weather has affected markets such as coffee, grains, and other markets and some trade strategies.

15,"Mark your Calendars: UN NDC report, Sept 17","As you may know, the Paris Agreement's international 'NDC' report is meant to be updated every 5 years, but was delayed by COVID. It's now scheduled Sept 17, prior to which China has refused to increase its immediate commitments due to Trump's withdrawal, and has demanded the USA produce proof of a 'permanent commitment' like its own. Due to Trump's withdrawal, no advance information on the USA's own commitment is available.

So first off, why is 'net zero' by 2060 important? Here's the NASA data on which the Paris Accord set 2060 as the goal for net-zero carbon, because that's when at the measured rate of decline, there will be no arctic ice left. [https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/arctic-sea-ice/](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/arctic-sea-ice/)

https://preview.redd.it/esstyl6mysn71.jpg?width=1062&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=710678e6207163c720d32fc4042820b6ba36407f

Trump's argument was that the freedom of Americans to pursue happiness is necessary to 'Make America Great Again,' and therefore put economists in charge of determining which environmental regulations should be removed to produce the most immediate and greatest profit, as well as leaving the Paris Accord, placing international esteem for the USA on par with the only other five declining nations: Libya, Iran, Iraq, Eritrea, and Yemen.

At first, climate-change naysayers said the loss of arctic ice doesn't matter, because ice in the Antarctic was increasing. But that's no longer true. Then they said the USA had no responsibility, because China is worse, despite the fact that China is readying a response which it will be able to enact, being a single-party system, whereas the USA is buried in partisan hatred and still quibbling about enforcement of vaccination, wearing covid masks, race riots caused by a civil war 150 years ago, election fraud, gerrymandering, governor recall due to objections by 15% of the state assembly, gun control to stop mass shootings, access to abortion clinics, etc.  China has none of those problems and can still do something about its carbon emissions. At the moment, it appears the rest of the world might well have to carry through its threat to declare war on the USA for not doing enough to stop the disaster it's causing to others.

Trump repeatedly cut funding on climate research from the federal budget. But fortunately, the ARGO program to measure deep-sea currents and temperature was not discontinued, because the same network of buoys, still under deployment, informs super trawlers how to find large fish shoals. So we now have a thorough database of how the whole planet is affected by the USA's policy on climate change. We now know that the loss of the arctic ice cap would not only destroy the homeostatic system moderating the seasons in the Northern hemisphere, but would also cause *worldwide* catastrophic changes in weather patterns, the likes of which civilization has never known.

The USA now wants China to do more, because then the USA could do less. **In fact that's been the prevailing response on Reddit, that China should do more, and the USA need do nothing because China is naughty.** That rather flies in the face of facts, as China has provided a schedule to reach net zero, and has made the infrastructure changes already to meet a 25% reduction in coal usage by 2026. The USA flip-flopped on doing anything at all, and has not provided a schedule yet.

The USA's schedule for reduction of carbon emissions is meant to be public in two days.

China's demand for a 'permanent commitment' remains a difficult situation to Kerry, who is scheduled to represent the USA versus China on controlling carbon emissions, because an election in 3 years could void any promise he makes; something Kerry knows all too well, as the USA already reneged on his 15-state multinational agreement on limiting Iran's nuclear development under the Bush II administration. The fickleness of the GOP in keeping international agreements is now no longer a fluke event. It's a pattern.

As a result, other nations have no faith in the USA keeping its commitments on carbon emissions either. Kerry is left to slug it out with Xi Jinping, mano a mano, in the November Glasgow summit.

Maybe it's just as well Trump also increased military spending to four times that of China in his first year in office, however much that was at odds with his Nationalist position. One of the main benefits of a Nationalist position is that its policy on non-interference is meant to reduce the need for military expenditure. However, China responded by doubling its military spending already, besides which, China has quadruple the manpower. So if it's going to be a military resolution of who's to blame for turning Earth into a living hell, sooner would be better than later for the USA.",climatechange,1631770808
16,"If we actually continue to burn green house gases for the rest of this century there is very little possibility for the continuation of life on earth for a very long time. Even if it doesn’t fully eradicate life, every extinction event has fully eradicated the most successful species of its cycle.","Possibly the hardest thing to imagine is one’s own death. It seems to be like an unlock-able part of one’s brain, how can one entertain the lack of ones own meaningful existence?

The more morbidly curious of you might search in hope of figuring out. Learning about near death experiences and the feelings connected with them. Maybe learning about the chemistry of a dying body. Maybe even watching somebody die, either getting executed on some live leak video or eaten by some animal. And in all this frantic anxious searching what did you find out? Did you really learn what it is to die? To be dead?

You may have seen a person’s pain as they are ripped apart or they plead for life. If you are particularly empathetic you might have almost felt that pain. But that pain is knowable, it can happen and be reanalyzed by our brains. But there is no empathizing with  a dead body. There is no body language or voice to interpret, there is nothing, because a dead body isn’t a person anymore. They are just what a human being really is, a pile of meat, bones, and chemicals. 

There is a certain irony that I sometimes think is lost on people that we are using the remains of a long dead ecology to lead us to a similar demise. Not just in the dramatic irony, like a villain dying by a weapon of his own creation. But in the idea that we at least in some way can imagine what it’s like to die, at least as a civilization.

What is our response to this? Is it a frantic anxiety? An aloof resignation? No it is complete and utter awe. The idea that best explains how little we matter, that we really are just meat, bone, and chemicals. 

There are a lot of things that we hear about climate change, pretty much all are true and all are horrifying. Constant intense storms, rising waters, droughts and massive fires, etc. But those are things humanity can survive? They will be horrifying and devastating but we have survived disasters before. No the most deadly thing is the massive level of ecological change. 

Throughout the many extinction cycles there is one thing that ensures the death of a top predator, massive, unassailable ecological change. This is because of the massive dependence they have on the rest of the ecology they exist in, if that changes their evolutionary advantage is made moot. Drastic enough over a short enough period of time and there is no amount of evolution that can fix that. That species is selected against, extinction. What I’m trying to say is we aren’t going out with a bang we are going out with the last whimpers of the starving.

Now one can imagine some historical contingency happening in the next 20 years where the devastation is so severe that there is no other direction to go but work to fix this problem. For me this brings up thoughts of the Cuban missile crisis. There are lots of important contingencies in this piece of history but one that I think is very important is the US election of 1960. It is very likely Kennedy could be considered the most stable hand at the wheel of any US president. He constantly doubted the info the cia gave him and pushed back against much of the hawkishness of his administration because of the failure of the bay of pigs invasion early in his term. If we had Nixon handling the big red button we would likely be living in a nuclear winter right now.

The big thing i’m trying to say is that no matter how devastating an event might be it doesn’t suddenly mean things are going to suddenly align and work out, those are separate events. More importantly climate change isn’t a bang. We already let millions die every year from starvation even though we have the resources, how many millions more until we decide to change it? 

On Easter island there use to be lush forests, the logs were often used to create not just there boats but also to help them move the moai, those giant stone heads they believed were tributes to their gods. At some point all the forests were chopped down inevitably leading to the fall of the Rapa Nui people. Someone had to have chopped that last tree down. What do you believe they were thinking? Do you think they even knew? How could they if it’s so hard to imagine one’s death.

My useful discussion here, beyond just arguing there is a rather large non-zero chance humanity will not see the end of the century because of the way historical contingency seems to work, is that our failure to do anything meaningful about climate change yet is not because people are dumb or selfish, but because of a failure of imagination.

Is that a worthy epitaph for the tombstone of humanity? a failure of imagination. In context of all that I ask one final question of you reader,

Can you imagine what it’s like to die?",climatechange,1631158451

A biblical perspective of the times we are living in.","To help put the following in context, this website covers an extensive list of end times bible prophecies coming to pass indicating the end of the age, a time foretold to be filled with various calamities and plagues. [https://www.signs-of-end-times.com](https://www.signs-of-end-times.com)

Luke 21:25-28 is one of many verses from the holy bible that Jesus spoke of that foretold some of the signs and world conditions that would indicate the end of the age.

&gt;""25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; 26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. 27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.""

We have been experiencing distress and perplexity of nations upon the earth unlike anything in modern history. There have been record hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, and flooding which appears to relate to “the sea and the waves roaring” and according to research this was a one time celestial alignment involving the sun, moon, and stars that accurately matches the reading of Revelation 12:1-2 word-for-word, the last book of the Bible concerning the foretold end times.

19,Go Gang Green!!!,"Climate change/global warming is undoubtedly real. Anyone thinking otherwise probably still leaves cookies out for Santa, or just hasn't ever thought about it and possess a futile IQ. 
We have reasons to believe there was an ice age....so obviously there's been a trend of warming since then. So those who deny the planet is on a warming trend should probably have there tongues and fingers removed to prevent them from sharing any info about anything. 
The natural warming occurrence of the planet has obviously been given a steroidal injection by means of human activity. I believe that should be pretty fn obvious. Im not a researcher or scientist with a lifetime dedicated to finding a cure, so like most people, I'm pretty ignorant. But unlike most, I'm able to admit that. 
Tbh, idk if I'm more terrified by the ""woke"" or ""unwoke"" population. 
Its hard to place blame on the ""unwoke"" older generation of people. All of the blame belongs to some of those fuckers but for the most part I can't blame the majority. I don't care if they still think climate change is fake, Oswald shot JFK, and man has walked on the moon. Its not their fault, they lived an entirely different existence. I've always questioned everything so its hard not to judge them for believing everything they were told, but thats how they were trained from infancy. Do what your parents say. Unfortunately, everyone was brainwashed from the top of society and had no real opportunity to escape that facade. So they've lived a life of being mislead. Sure they could become awaken in today's world and for younger people its easy to say they should. I can say with almost total certainty that when I'm 70-80, (old af), I will have 0 desire to change a lifetime of beliefs while I coast out the rest of my days. Again, its easy for present day me to say old me is an inconsiderate p.o.s., but old me is worn out and very likely tired of things changing. Aside from a few, most everyone I knew is dead, the places I made cherished memories are gone and replaced with concrete and stores. I would find it very hard to put energy towards developing a new way of thinking while I hang on to happy memories that happened under different planetary/societal circumstances. Totalitarian blame deserves to go to prior generations. Ima guess that very few/none of us has ever conversed with those deserving of the blame. 
So next time you talk to someone that is obviously not living in reality, don't get pissed at them and judge the entire slew for what they believe. Personally, I just make an internal note of sympathy on their behalf and go on my way. I don't debate with or try to change what they think. Mainly because I don't waste time and energy on shit void of benefits and also I like the idea of letting people die happy with their beliefs. I can't imagine too many things worse than approaching the light at the end of the tunnel with some serious internal conflicts going on.
My empathy and sympathy pertains to 99% of them that aren't really at fault in the first place and can't really help with improvements anyways. Instead of fighting with and trying to change the 1% able of making change, they just need to be removed from their positions. How? Idk, but energy would be better spent on removal than transitioning them.

Actually, I guess I do know who I find more terrifying. Its not the diminishing group that got put us in this position. Their damage is already done for the most part. 
I am a bit scared of the wokes, though. I love people having the mindset of making things better and conscious of the planet's wellbeing. I like it, (I like it a loht). I like people wanting to become more aware and knowledgeable. I don't like how people think they are better than others just because they have interpreted information they believe is 100% factual. 
Pretty much the only guaranteed fact that exists is that we ultimately don't know shit. We may have evidence suggesting its factual, but how do we know we have all of the evidence? How do we know the evidence has been interpreted correctly? Even if it was, was it correctly/truthfully communicated by those in the know? 
As hard as it is for me to imagine past people just believing what they were told even though they had very little information  accessible to them. Its harder to believe that today people can be so certain about something they read somewhere. I mean I get the psychological reasons, its easy to get on board with something that aligns with what we believe and vice versa. I just feel we as a species should be past those by now. The simple fact that there is probably a completely contradictory side to whatever it is should make people at least stop and think like, hey maybe there is a 1% chance its not how I think, instead of just disregarding the fake news. There's at least 3 sides to every story and that only gets vastly multiplied on the internet. So how are people able to be so certain? 

I'm pretty positive humans are fucking up the planet. I am about as sold on that  as i can get. I'm just not necessarily sold on the reasons that people with hidden agendas say. I'm not suggesting their claims of pollution and emissions are bogus. That shit seems pretty obvious. I don't need to read an intellects article to ""inform"" me. What happens when you sit in a running vehicle in a closed garage? Lightheaded, nasuea, and eventual death. Right? Why would anyone think the world isn't a much, much larger garage? Exactly, so combustion engines are killing us, should be obvious. Many of the things that are supposedly killing the planet seem pretty obvious. You won't find me saying any of it is good and isn't getting momma earth all hot and bothered. 
I graduated from college with a BS, but common sense is far more educational than any university course. It may not produce an expert in any one field, but it does provide knowledge that is widely applicable. It serves as my base information source on most topics and is responsible for the a lot of my actions and beliefs. 
Maybe I'm just a dumb/ignorant farmer that grew up and spent most of my time in the middle of nowhere. Honestly, I was quite shocked when I heard the news that I'm apparently one of the main reasons causing the impending doom. If it weren't for motivatimed agendas I would have never been aware of the devastating consequences of my daily actions. 
I've always been fascinated by and appreciative of the big momma E. Most notably the ground where things grow and the air I breathe. Even as a tike, I was conscious of what humans were doing to her. I would compare the present day way of living and the affects to the wild west days of horses buggies. I wasn't really aware of the magnitude of destruction or anything but I just felt it wasn't as pure of an existence we are living. So anytime I think about the impact of humans, I compare present day with the pre industrial days.
I still have a lot of room for more wokeness to learn how I can quit contributing to killing all of us. But as I await the opening of my eyes I can't help but view things through common sense lenses. 
Im not delusional and believe that farming doesn't have negative environmental effects. I mean, I literally can't think of anything that doesn't for fuck sakes haha. I guess my astonishment upon hearing the news that I'm a horrible being came from the fact that I've never became nauseous or suffered a headache from breathing the air on a farm. My eyes haven't burnt from the hazey cloud hanging around. With wide open Montana being a possible exception, idk if there's a more rural area than where I live. Its literally agriculture for hundreds of miles in every direction before there is any type of substantial mass of people and pavement. If there was an area where the immediate effects of farming were felt, id be in it. So forgive my dumbfoundedness. Anytime I go to a metro area for a few days I can't wait to get back so I can breathe good air again. I realize the detriment can extend beyond the immediate area, but to claim the emissions from farm machinery is a huge problem is beyond ignorant to just fucking stupid. Maybe 40-50 years ago when there were 10 tractors pumping out the black smoke in every field. I'm sure there's an industrial park in one city that produces what all tractors collectively emit. 

Common sense also suggests something I have never seen or heard anyone mention a contributing factor to the world heating up. I've seen the studies showing the correlation of hotter temps and cars over the last 100 yrs. I'm not saying cars don't emit naughty gas. But why doesn't anyone take it a step further? Have you ever seen or heard about the tire problems of 100 yrs ago? I don't guess i really have either. I'm not an expert, but if i had to guess, I'd say they did indeed have tire issues. It wouldn't have been from all the kids uglying up all the streets by burning their tires and leaving black marks everywhere. It would've been from the shitty/rocky/unpaved roads they drove on. If one was to consider every highway, road, and street that is paved, they would realized quite a bit of earth is underneath. Don't forget about everything like parking lots, runways, steel buildings ect. It may not seem like much on the grand scale of things. But you're fucking higher than I've ever been if you don't think the sun beaming off of all of that heat-retaining concrete, asphalt, ect hasnt made things a tad warmer. When I compare today to the way back days, I can't help but feel pretty confident in thinking that the accumulated effect of today's landscape wouldn't play a significant role in the accelerated temperature rise. 
It also probably doesn't help that watering restrictions are causing people to add more rock and artificial turf to their yards. When I was doing landscaping up by the city the grass to not grass ratio was crazy to me. I grew up on a dirt road without any pavement for 8 miles. So going to these ""country houses"" &lt;- was funny to me. First off, I could probably throw a baseball from one spot and hit 30 houses and there were hundreds more lined up past those. Each one had a very small patch of grass in front and one in back maybe twice the size. Nearly everyone had some type of rockscape that equaled the front grass. With a paved street, sidewalks, driveways,  and the house itself I'd guess that maybe 5-10% of land in a neighborhood had living grass or plants. And that's the earthy part of cities aside from a park here and there. Which are completely surrounded by heat-retaining earth-covering materials. 

But i guess educated persons don't see it the same as I do. There will be more natural earth smothered for human luxury next year and the years following.  While experts and wannabe sperts ignore the obviousness of it and direct their blame elsewhere. 

Writing this might have convinced me that this is far more detrimental than just a small factor like I originally believed. Maybe I have too much respect for BIG Momma E and her powers but something tells me she is capable of fixing herself. Im sure its more likely that she would be able to fix herself in terms of the greenhouses gases that originated from within her in the first place. Maybe were putting them out at a rate she can't contend with, maybe she can adapt a quicker method. I think in time she could also overcome the concrete blanket she's getting but not at the rate we keep knitting additional pieces. There's just no fn way she can conjure up that kind of healing power to compete at this pace. 

Maybe I'm way wrong, maybe I'm just defensive and not easily accepting of the never-ending attacks on ag, so I'm fabricating the first alternatives I can think of. I'm not accusing anyone of anything, I believe that as conscious individuals most people are good. At least in their core. Seemingly all to often it can get masked by their greed and ego. 
Genuine planetary concern is becoming more and more prominent and that's a great thing. I just hope everyone can check their hiprocracy at the door and refrain from making attacks towards others without really knowing the reasons for such attacks. 

What would an alien, with no previous knowledge or bias, perceive as being more environmentally toxic if they were to spend a week on a farm and a week in the city? 

I believe there's pretty much only one solution for legitimately reduce the wounds of the ass kicking we've been giving BIG Momma E.    (Aside from a mass depopulation, which wouldn't actually be a solution as much as it would just prolong the consequences of our behavior). 
There are other potential solutions that may come to fruition in the future. But as of today, there's only one solution that I can see for true change to actually happen. Though it'll never happen, not until its far too late and it simply has to happen. 
If every human was a vegan and every vehicle was electric, would the world be saved? I'm pretty sure the answer is no. The destruction might get delayed, but no one knows what the consequences of today's actions will be in fifty years. Unless we find/build something that can make everything us humans need out of thin air, our attempts will be moot. 
Any green movement or vegan agenda won't matter without an extreme societal    change in civilization. But like Ive already said,  that will never happen.  
This is already wayyyyy longer than intended so I'll save my solution for those that are interested. Cause lordy knows this one is long enough, haha.

22,Moving house/ buying land as a preparatory measure,"I am considering my future with climate change in mind. Specifically, I am wondering about where I live and how/ where I can move to prepare.

I currently live, with my wife and young son, in a town in the north of Ireland. Our town (Elevation: 74m / 243feet) has three substantial rivers that converge in the centre of the town. At times of torrential rain, the river can &amp; have burst their banks and flood the town (this is also true of the river that runs past the lowest part of our park - which has flooded as recently as 9 months ago). 

My question is, am I silly to be considering moving house - to not only keep my family safe in the future, but also to protect our largest asset (our house)?

If we were to move, will it be easier to cope with the symptoms of an ever changing climate somewhere more rural, on an elevated piece of land with renewable energy (wind and solar), with a small plot for growing our own food?

This one — and I don’t recommend you read this essay if you’re at all feeling anxious or depressed — goes like this.

Here’s the way that I think about the future — don’t worry, this isn’t the thought itself, just the context. The 30s are going to be the decade of global warming (aka “climate change”) turning catastrophic. Megafire, megaflood, megatyphoon, “heat domes” — all these will replace the gentle seasons as we once thought of them. The 40s, the decade when mass extinction — already accelerating — begins to upend the basic systems of our civilization. And the 50s will be the decade of the Final Goodbye — when our civilisation’s systems simply crash and come to a halt, food, air, water, medicine, all in short supply, because we cannot produce them anymore, having killed the living planet.

That much you should already be able to feel. In the searing temperatures of the twin heat domes still covering much of the planet. In the way that much of the planet can’t get vaccines for a new plague. Or the way that a new plague is simply being left to breed new variants, each more infectious and deadly than the last.

What I’ve described to you is a set of megatrends. But beneath them runs another one, perhaps the grimmest of all.

The age of the Great Dying has begun.

I know that sounds grandiose, melodramatic, and faintly ridiculous. I don’t want it to be true, and I don’t write it for hyperbole’s sake. Let me simply present you with some facts that will explain what I mean — and leave you, probably, as chilled as I am.

A grim threshold was recently crossed. 4 million people around the world are now dead of Covid. How many people is that? More than in all the wars in the last half century or so. It’s nearly the population of a country like Denmark. It’s a staggering number. And it’s only just the beginning. Let me come back to it, though. For now, let’s call it 5 million, because even epidemiologists will agree it’s certainly a dramatic underestimate.

Another such line was crossed, too. Extreme temperatures now kill more than 5 million people a year. That number, too, is going to rise dramatically, because we’re only at the very beginning of a trend of runaway warming.

Put those together, and you already have 10 million people dead. In the last year or so. From a new pandemic, and from a warming planet. Ten million people.

How many is that? It’s more than the populations of Denmark and New Zealand. More than the population of New York City or London.

Let me say it again. Already — in this past year or so — ten million people are dead. Of things that did not exist a few years ago. A new pandemic, and a warming planet. More people are already dead from the new catastrophes we’ve made than make up entire countries.

Maybe now you see a little bit what I mean by this especially grim term “the Age of the Great Dying.” Still think it’s hyperbole, exaggeration, overstatement? (Maybe you do, if you’re a certain kind of privileged white American. So try imagining being the families of one of those ten million people who are already dead.)

Ten million dead and counting. I want you to reflect on that and think about it carefully. Did you know? Why didn’t you? What does it mean? Should you be indifferent to it? Is your ignorance manufactured for the benefit of elites, perhaps?

Ten million dead in one year from Covid and global warming. That’s how staggeringly fast what I’ve called “the Age of the Great Dying” is happening.

The crucial questions are: how many more will there be, and how fast?

The answers are not good. Covid is going endemic. Nobody cares about vaccinating the world, except a handful of doctors and scientists. Rich Westerners couldn't care less, so their governments don’t care, so Covid’s exploding worldwide. You know the story: new variants emerge, that are vaccine resistant, and everybody’s at risk from them, even in the rich West. Covid is becoming a new plague — it’s not just a pandemic anymore, a thing that goes away after a couple of years.

All that’s confirmed by the fact that the trend is accelerating. See that chart above? This last year or two’s 4 million deaths are just a beginning. The curve is bending upwards. That’s an ominous, horrific line to see. It hasn’t even hit an inflection point yet. The exponent is still growing. That means, in hard terms, we should expect to see double that number every year or two. 8 million? 16 million? 32 million? All these are very, very real possibilities.

But Covid’s not the only game of death in town.

Warming’s already killed five million people this year, roughly. We hear about the small catastrophes — a few hundred dead in Canada, another few in California, and so on. Of course those deaths are terrible and tragic and they matter. But the number of excess deaths ascribe to extreme temperatures far, far exceeds those. People simply dropping dead of heatstrokes, heart attacks, strokes, pulmonary issues, asthma attacks, and so on. That’s how you get five million dead of extreme heat already.

You can see that this summer is severely, severely abnormal. It’s shattered even the worst predictions. The twin heat domes lingering over the planet made parts of Canada as hot as the hottest place on earth, Jacobabad, Pakistan. The heat is off the charts almost everywhere on the planet. Take a look, for example, at this picture of planet earth.

Warming has only just begun. We’re already at five million dead a year. The temperature has barely even risen one full degree yet. We’re on course to hit four degrees or more. And every degree the temperature rises — the global mean — deaths will occur probably at exponentially greater rates. Barely hitting one degree puts us at five million deaths per year. Two? Probably easily an order of magnitude greater than that — fifty. Three? Five hundred. Four? Let’s not even go there.

If you don’t get why, just imagine how badly our civilisation is going to break. Just one degree of warming and Canada’s on fire. Now imagine two. Still think that power grid is going to supply the air conditioning that keeps you comfortable? Who’s going to be able to live in places like Las Vegas and California — or India, Pakistan, Iran, and, well, much of the planet? At three, the planet’s tropics have become Fire Belts, and societies simply stop working, as climate refugees flee by the millions, and even in survivable cities, simply going outside is taking your life into your own hands. And I haven’t even mentioned wet bulb temperature yet, which means: it’s impossible for you to survive, period.

Put just those two catastrophes together — global warming and Covid — and you have exponentially rising death rates over the foreseeable future. We hit ten million dead a year — snap — just like that, faster than you probably believed could happen. But that number is easily going to rise far, far higher — twenty, fifty, a hundred — faster than you can believe, too.

The human mind does not do well with exponential growth, and it doesn’t do well with death. That’s why most of us are in a desperately feigned indifference. Addicted to our dumb selfies and reality TV and violence and porn and consumerism harder than ever. We are trying, rather pathetically, to deny what’s right in front of our eyes.

The staggering toll of the catastrophes we face is not set in some distant, remote future. It is beginning to happen right here, right now.

The Age of the Great Dying has begun.

It’s not a joke, and it’s not a drill. If we were a saner kind of being than the vicious, greedy, domineering, hierarchically submissive primates we are — we might even care more. Enough to stop it. As it is, though, you can see another trend, hidden beneath the mass graves of the dead of this new Dark Age.

An even greater indifference.",climatechange,1626148069

***Throughout history, the climate on Earth has been changing.***  
Seven periods of glacial advance and retreat have occurred in the past 650,000 years, with the sudden termination of the last ice age around 11,700 years ago marking the onset of the current period of climate—and human civilization.  
All of these temperature changes are due to very small changes in Earth’s orbit that change the amount of solar energy that our planet absorbs.

## What is climate change?

**Climate change** is the long-term changes in the earth’s average temperature, The Earth’s average temperature is around 15C but it has been much higher and lower in the past. 

Of course, there are natural fluctuations in the climate however scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times, which means the world is getting warmer.

but not be confused with global warming which refers only to the rising of the surface temperatures on earth. Climate change includes global warming driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases plus the side effects of global warming, like melting glaciers, heavy rainstorms, or more severe droughts. To put it simply global warming is a result of a much broader human-caused climate change crisis.

Even though Climate change is a major issue facing our planet today, some people believe that it is all a hoax or fake science, or an overrated cause.

so here are some facts you might want to look into :

1. The planet is about 1C colder than it was before widespread industrialization, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
2. Three global environment and climate agencies reported the 10 years to the end of 2019 as the warmest decade ever.     
3. The past five years have been the warmest. Each decade from the 1980s has been successively warmer than all the decades that came before.        
4. Across the world, the average sea level rose by 3.6 mm per year between 2005 and 2015. Much of the change in sea level was once attributed to the thermal expansion of seawater. When the seawater warms up, the molecules become less densely concentrated, creating a rise in ocean depth.
5. The Greenland Ice Sheet has undergone record melting in recent years; if a total of 2.8 million cu km were to be melted, the sea level will increase by 6 m.
6. The impacts of climate change can also be found in plants and land animals. These include early flowering and fruiting times as well as changes in the ranges or territories.
7. The effects of a changing climate can also be seen in vegetation and land animals. These include earlier flowering and fruiting times for plants and changes in the territories (or ranges) occupied by land animals.

Now that we got that out of the way, you may ask what does this have to do with health?

Climate change represents a broad range of threats to public health. If global climate change continues along its current path, these risks will increase to potentially critical levels in the coming decades. The three main categories of health risks include direct effects due to heatwaves, amplified air pollution and physical weather disasters, climate-related impacts on ecological systems and relationships (crop yields, mosquito yields, The ecology of mosquitoes, marine productivity, and more indirect consequences such as effects of hunger due to poverty, migration, resource dispute (water) and post-disaster mental health issues.

## #1 Impact Of Excess Heat On The Human Body

# For Health &amp; Safety

#### Save The Earth

The healthy human body keeps its internal temperature at around 37°C. A change of more than 1°C could occur depending on the time of day, physical activity, and emotional state. A rise of body temperature above 1°C, occurs mainly during illness or when outside conditions are too harsh and extreme for the body to handle. The body increases the rate of heat loss to balance the heat burden in a hot environment. So as the temperature of the environment warms up, the body will automatically warm up as well and as the body’s temperature rises which could lead to the following illnesses :

* **Heat edema** is a type of swelling that occurs among people who are climatically used to working in hot conditions
* **Heat cramps** are a pain in the muscles due to salt imbalance ( electrolyte insufficiency) from excessive sweating, they could occur combined with other heat stressors.
* Heat syncope is dizziness and fainting induced by heat and insufficient flow of blood to the brain while standing. People usually recover fast after resting for a while in a cool area.
* **Heatstroke** is definitely the most dangerous type of heat illness. The signs include body temperature over 41°C, as well as complete or partial loss of consciousness. Heatstroke demands immediate first aid and medical assistance. It could be lethal if not treated immediately.

## #2 Impact On Diseases

A changing climate and warming oceans are causing extreme weather patterns which have contributed to an increase of infectious diseases both new and reemerging.

These intense weather variations produce prolonged rainy seasons in some regions, and prolonged drought periods in others, as well as introducing new climates to various regions. These prolonged seasons create climates that can support vectors for longer periods of time, allowing them to multiply rapidly, and also creating climates that allow the introduction and introduction of vectors.

## #3 Malaria

Malaria is a parasitic disease transmitted by mosquitoes that infect humans and other species. Since mosquitoes lack the mechanisms to monitor their internal temperature, malaria is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. There were about 214 million cases of malaria in 2015 and a record 438,000 deaths from malaria.

## #4 Dengue fever

Dengue fever is an infectious disease in tropical areas that is believed to be caused by dengue viruses. The cases of the disease have increased dramatically since the 1970s. There is no vaccine for dengue fever right now and no true treatment to get rid of it. Dengue fever has been spreading further and further north due to climate change. The disease is transmitted by the mosquito Aedes or A. aegypti. Some of the symptoms are fever, headache, muscle, and joint pains, and skin rash. The hotter and wetter a climate is, the faster the mosquitoes can mature and develop the disease. The more mosquitoes that are mature, the quicker the disease can develop. El Nino effects are causing the climate to change in different areas of the world, causing the disease to spread.

## #5 Leishmaniasis

Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease induced by Leishmania genus parasites and spread by sand flies. The [**WHO**](https://www.who.int/en) reports that 12 million people around the world are infected with the illness. Risk factors include poverty, urbanization, erosion, and climate change. Developing the parasite within the sandfly can also be influenced by temperature variations. Climate change has been expected to improve the necessary conditions for phlebotomist species in Central Europe.

## #6 Tick-borne disease

The high humidity of more than 85 percent is the ideal environment for a tick to start and finish its life cycle. The maximum temperature was determined to be the most influential element in the conservation of tick populations. Climate effect on the tick life cycle is one of the most challenging predictions to render in relation to climate and vector-borne disease. Unlike other vectors, tick life cycles cover several seasons as they mature from larva to nymph to adult. Expansion in tick colonies is associated with global climate change.. In Colorado, the Rocky Mountain wood tick is known as D. Anderson is located around the front and wants to eat and as a result, infect human populations with tularemia (Francisella tularensis), Rocky Mountain spotted fever ([**Rickettsia**](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickettsia#:~:text=Rickettsia%20rickettsii%20est%20l'agent,Rocheuses%2C%20en%20Am%C3%A9rique%20du%20nord.) rickettsii), and Colorado tick fever (CTF virus)

## #7 Covid 19

According to the United Nations Environment Program, the Coronavirus disease 2019 is zoonotic, meaning the virus is passed from animals to humans. A large part of the causes is environmental, such as climate change. The U.N. concludes that the most fundamental way to protect ourselves is to prevent the destruction of nature. In April 2020 the U.S. government published 2 short videos explaining the link between nature destruction (including climate change), wildlife trade, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

# #8 Impact On Mental Health

Climate change, along with other natural and human-made health stressors, has a wide variety of effects on human health and disease. Any current health threats will worsen and new health threats will arise. Not everybody is at the same risk though. Significant factors include age, economic capital, and location., veterans with preexisting mental illness after a natural disaster were almost seven times more likely to experience new mental illness resulting in suicides. For example, after hurricane Katrina, Suicide attempts increased 15 times relative to regional rates for women living in temporary housing, and the rate of violent crime, including murder and abuse against women, increased dramatically after Hurricane Katrina.

25,How should I plan for the future in this seemingly hopeless situation?,"This type of post is likely overdone, but if I don’t write my thoughts down somewhere they’re only going to continue to madden me. 

I’m 22 y/o, and already I feel as though there is little to no point in continuing life. By no means am I suicidal or anything like that, but I find myself filled with despair, a despair which has only worsened in these past several weeks. Climate change is the number one thing on my mind, and the number one influencer of my decisions, almost all the time. I can’t escape it, and can feel it actively making me a jaded and pessimistic person. 

As I prepare for the future of my life post-college, I am finding enormous difficulty in giving a damn about anything. In my job search I am trying to be conscious about where I end up applying to regionally, not because it’s where I want to go but because it may allow me to live longer once shit hits the fan. I am finding myself consumed with bitter thoughts, seeing building developments under construction and wondering why they are even doing it when soon none of it’s going to matter. I have begun to plan a life of self sustainability, living off the land and whatnot, but fear I won’t have enough time to get my life in order and make enough money to make this happen. I have already accepted the reality that I cannot have children without damning them to an incredibly difficult life.

Worst of all is the fact that nobody else in my life seems to care. It’s not that I’m surrounded by deniers, but rather by people who know what is happening and yet continue on living business as usual. When I try to talk to them about the true extent of the damage to come, they tell me I’m too pessimistic and that there is still time to stop climate change. I don’t believe that, but I do believe there’s still time to adapt to it. 

I worry that I am growing disassociated with society and the ones closest to me in my own life. I channel my worry through unhealthy coping mechanisms, justifying them to myself by saying that it won’t matter in a decade or two from now when shit has really hit the fan. I feel as though I’m going crazy when I’m considering that these thoughts disassociate me from society, when in actuality I believe society is disassociated from the truth of our situation because it is too difficult to think about. I seriously just don’t know how to cope with these things. I’ll continue my job search and try to live a “normal life”, but I can’t shake the feeling that it’s all for nothing and that I’d be better off spending this time just doing whatever I want, even if it costs me all I own. I’m too young to have already given up on life, but I don’t really want to be around for too much longer and that’s the truth I cannot get past",climatechange,1625228975

You can try this yourself by putting an ice cube in a glass of water, and as it melts you can see that the surface of the water does not rise.

30,Attribution of the Australian bushfire risk to anthropogenic climate change,"From the abstract:

&gt;Therefore, we find that climate change has induced a higher weather-induced risk of such an extreme fire season. This trend is mainly driven by the increase of temperature extremes. In agreement with previous analyses we find that heat extremes have become more likely by at least a factor of 2 due to the long-term warming trend. However, current climate models overestimate variability and tend to underestimate the long-term trend in these extremes, so the true change in the likelihood of extreme heat could be larger, suggesting that the attribution of the increased fire weather risk is a conservative estimate. We do not find an attributable trend in either extreme annual drought or the driest month of the fire season, September–February. The observations, however, show a weak drying trend in the annual mean. For the 2019/20 season more than half of the July–December drought was driven by record excursions of the Indian Ocean Dipole and Southern Annular Mode, factors which are included in the analysis here. The study reveals the complexity of the 2019/20 bushfire event, with some but not all drivers showing an imprint of anthropogenic climate change.

35,Anxiety growing out of control.,"So, I don't want this to be a doomer post. Though I have noticed more of those lately. This sub and some others have actually been huge in leading me to good resources. And while I wouldn't use a word as strong as optimism. It has helped me to realize some important things about climate change. Either from resources on this sub, or from other sources I found on the way. And I'm glad I learned those things, they did spur me to start looking into being more involved. (Even started joining the climate action lobby.)

A couple of weeks ago a promoted article on Twittter, from Bloomberg no less, sent me into a doom spiral. My fixation on this ruined my sleep schedule for a week. I believe it was about the methane feedback loops. There were some great resources on this sub that made me much more aware of how that worked, how long methane lasts in the atmosphere, and led me to a great scientist on Twitter who talked about the flaws in that study. I was able to get back to normal for a while.

That was just the start of the pattern where I will start reading about climate change, trends in fighting it, mitigation ideas and plans, etc. Recently, I think the second incident, it was an article about how the collapse of civilization may have already started. Some common sense discussions on this sub and reading about the actual effects of climate changed helped a lot with that one.

Just today, while reading about how some scenarios don't account for or may be underrepresented in models. I came across a very troubling piece on the amazon rainforest. Ashamed to admit that I had nearly forgotten that it was facing the highest deforestation in decades. And according to some notable researchers. Could be closer to the tipping point where it becomes a net carbon source than we thought before. ( Related piece: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/science-environment-51464694?__twitter_impression=true ) And that aridification and turning into a savannah may begin by the mid 2030's.

This is troubling because the Amazon is a massive net sink, and this tipping point could result in something like 12 years of emissions being released from the dying trees as it tranfers from rainforest to savannah. Making goals of even 2C impossible. 

As a bright spot, one of the authors did note, if I'm interpreting him correctly, that he thinks it'd take 10-15 years at current deforestation to reach that tipping point. And he also believes it's still possible to use sustainable methods in deforested areas of the rainforest. My worry is if he's wrong, I still worry about the other estimates being wrong too. 

I'd love to hear from anyone sensible about this scenario. I know it's hard to predict the future, but for that same reason I'd also say things sometimes turn out worse than we guessed. And I haven't seen a lot of discussion about it after the article was posted in March/Feb.

37,Having children -quantitative analysis of the Lund Uni paper,"

TLDR at the bottom

Let me preface this by this analysis took me about an hour and I ran my very simple model maybe 7-8 times for different situations. **I am very open to feedback and discussion**

I posted yesterday about having children and it generated quite heated discussion. A link was posted that referenced this paper

[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/meta](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/meta)

**I have linked this paper several times myself and I have seen many people do so on this sub. However I thought I might take a closer look at it, as it is often referenced through media and on this sub and it is worth looking at the paper more closely.**

**I will first explain why I believe the analysis this paper conducts is not within a reasonable framework. I will then quantitatively argue the paper is completely justified in its analysis in the terms it has set out for itself. I will then attempt to argue against the way the media has portrayed the paper.**

eg:

58 -59 tonnes of c02 a year is the quoted figure. Per child. This is a REALLY big number. The guardian reports this as 'is going child FREE the answer to the climate crisis?'

So I looked at the assumptions of the paper. The paper actually bases its calculation on an earlier paper:

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378008001003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378008001003)

**I will first explain why I believe the analysis this paper conducts is not within a reasonable framework.**

1: Our most far flung climate models end at 2100. In order for this paper to generate the numbers it has, it has to go way beyond 2100, where we can not predict the behaviour of human beings. The numbers eventually asymptote when your responsible for only a fraction of your descendents emissions due to being distantly related to them

2: It pins all responsibility for the emission of your offspring and their offsrping etc on you. Why do we not just pass the buck up to our parents? And call our emissions zero? It was all our parents emissions, not ours.

From what I can tell study assumes everyone in the future related to you has ZERO emissions. They are all yours.

**I will then quantitatively argue the paper is completely justified in its analysis in the terms it has set out for itself.**

The 2009 paper makes it clear that

'Under current conditions in the United States, for example, each child adds about 9441 metric tons of carbon dioxide to the carbon legacy of an average female, which is 5.7 times her lifetime emissions. A person’s reproductive choices must be considered along with his day-to-day activities when assessing his ultimate impact on the global environment. '

This assumes emissions do not drop from when the paper was written.

So I plugged in the co2 emissions per capita of the united states into a model I made with the following method. I was as HARSH as possible on the emissions of the individual

You are responsible for half your childrens emissions, a quarter of your grandchildren etc.

A person and their desendents will have children age 25 (early compared to most data in western nations) and by the 3rd generation will live to 100 years each.

I then summed the total emissions of all descendents until an asypmtote was reached. and divided the number by 55 (the number of years left in your life if you have a child at 25).

The number I got was suitably huge. 28 tonnes of CO2 per year per child. However still only half of what the paper got. as I said I only have access to the abstract, but I would guess it is because I only took into account territorial emissions.

**I will then attempt to argue against the way the media has portrayed the paper.**

However, When I put in the average co2 emissions only 4 years later for USA (CO2 emissions per capita are decreasing in the US), This number drops by **10%.** After only 4 years of emmission drops.

**THIS IS SOMETHING THE AUTHORS OF THE PAPER MENTION, BUT THE MEDIA SEEMS TO NOT REPORT ON.**

*&gt; Family size also mattered: when accounting for the impact of future descendants at current emission rates, having one fewer child would save 58.6 tonnes per year. However, reducing overall national emissions could make the climate impact of an additional child up to 17 times less.*

Indeed I again ran the numbers through my model with the following parameters.

The USA reaches net zero in 2070

People live to 100

People have children at 25.

I did this for several other nations as well as well as the UK

If the USA reaches net zero by 2070, using the exact same criteria, lifetime emissions per year of having a child drops by 80%.

In the UK, I put 2070 in as well, even though the UK has a net zero target of 2050,and emissions have dropped by about 20% since the writing of the paper. If the UK is net zero by 2070, the result in a massive 90% drop in emissions per year of having a child. If the UK reaches net zero on target ( I don't believe it will), it will be closer to 95%)

The point remains that even with the modest drops in co2 emissions to date per capita in the countries that were used as models by these papers you see a 10-20% drop in the in the emissions per child per year.

is often used to say having children is the worst thing for the planet.

This is widely in my opinion, mis represented in media. The media claims every child we have adds 58 tonnes of CO2 to atmosphere per year we are alive.

We do not assume climate models can go past 2100, but to gain the numbers the media reports from this paper, the projections must be ran way past 2100.

The media also does not take into account the emissions that have already been cut in the developed nations the paper discusses.

It also assumes that CO2 will remain as is (or rise? cant tell from the abstract) per capita. In nearly every developed nation this is not true, CO2 per capita is dropping.

My analysis indicates that having children is probably still the worst thing you can do for the planet, but not to the levels indicated in the media. This is probably analysis already done by the original paper but not widely broadcast.

**In fact the paper itself concludes that having one less child would have the largest impact. It does not as the media portrays, advocate not having children**

*&gt; We have identified four recommended actions which we believe to be especially effective in reducing an individual's greenhouse gas emissions: having one fewer child,*

40,This is evidence it may be too late,"Human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases – are a primary driver of climate change – and present one of the world’s most pressing challenges.1 This link between global temperatures and greenhouse gas concentrations – especially CO2 – has been true throughout Earth’s history.2

To set the scene, let’s look at how the planet has warmed. In the chart we see the global average temperature relative to the average of the period between 1961 and 1990.

The red line represents the average annual temperature trend through time, with upper and lower confidence intervals shown in light grey.

We see that over the last few decades, global temperatures have risen sharply — to approximately 0.7℃ higher than our 1961-1990 baseline. When extended back to 1850, we see that temperatures then were a further 0.4℃ colder than they were in our baseline. Overall, this would amount to an average temperature rise of 1.1℃.

Because there are small year-to-year fluctuations in temperature, the specific temperature increase depends on what year we assume to be ‘pre-industrial’ and the end year we’re measuring from. But overall, this temperature rise is in the range of 1 to 1.2℃.3",climatechange,1606659471

The film looks at various environmental concerns, including global warming, water use, deforestation, and ocean dead zones, and suggests that animal agriculture is the primary source of environmental destruction. 

From the [[official website]](https://www.cowspiracy.com/):

Have many of the people here seen it? I've just watched it and am wondering what people here thought. 

Personally I think on the list of popular conspiracies, I think a minority are 'mostly true'. This includes the paid-for promotion of bogus and corrupt Food Guide Pyramids in the USA, the burying of climate change information and sowing of disinformation by fossil fuel lobby groups, and the dissemination of 'low fat' health disinformation by the sugar industries. After watching COWSPIRACY it seems that not only is it one of Life on Planet Earth's worst problems, it's one that is unrecognised by most of the world's population, and covered up by entire industries and entire governments. 

If I recall, 60% of mammal biomass on planet Earth is animal livestock, and 36% is humans, leaving only 4% to all wild mammals. I have asked a lot of people to guess percentages, and NOBODY has guessed that wild mammals are below 20% of the total. No surprise then that the water and methane from livestock dwarfs most other contributors to our GHG and water budgets yet goes unrecognised or underappreciated by even some of the largest environmentalist groups.",climatechange,1606509734

I know that I'm all over in this topic and I am sorry for this. At the moment I am confused and emotional and I am looking for advice on how to deal with this whole issue. My mental health has degraded to a point where I am hopeless and depressed, petrified and paralyzed due to the overwhelming nature of the issues our world is facing, namely climate change and the holocene extinction event and I am here looking for a productive and healthy discussion.

To get my post started: Really, what is the point of even trying anymore? I'm in my twenties and the world is going to face disasters of a scale never seen before within my lifetime. The world wars or even the black plague are nothing compared to whats coming. I have to decide on how to spend the rest of my life, what to study, where to work, what kind of family I want but it all seems completely pointless. There is no point to anything anymore. I always wanted to have my own family with ONE child, but how would it be moral and reasonable to put more children into this world? Even the thought of having children seems to border on malevolence and insanity. The more I read about this topic, the more depressed I and hopeless become.

No matter where I go, I see articles of doom and hellscapes. Every top comment under every Reddit post seems to be ""worse than previously though"", ""faster than expected"", ""lol too late, we're doomed"".

And from what I can tell, even the scientist have started to let on that we are nowhere near a reasonable emission path. One of the most prominent scientist Michael Mann says that another term of trump would be ""game over"" for our planet:

( https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/02/donald-trump-climate-change-michael-mann-interview?__twitter_impression=true )

Adding to that, the last IPCC report appears to have underestimated the dangers, as a new report by the WMO &amp; UN says:

&gt; The findings of the reports are sobering: despite scientific warnings, increased political and societal attention and the Paris Agreement, global GHG emissions have continued to increase and the emissions gap is larger than ever (Figure 1). Even with full implementation of the current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the Emissions Gap in 2030 will be around 15 Gt of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e) for a 2 °C goal, and 32 GtCO2e for a 1.5 °C goal (both with a probability of at least 66%). To give an indication of the magnitude of this gap, the total emissions of the six largest emitters, that is, China, USA, EU28, India, Russia and Japan was around 32 GtCO2e in 2018 (Figure 2). The current level of climate ambition sets us on course to a global average temperature increase of 3.0 to 3.2 °C by the end of this century.
Transformational change needed to close the emissions gap

&gt; The challenge is clear: if we want to keep the Paris Agreement goals of limiting global warming to well below 2 °C and pursuing a 1.5 °C goal alive, postponing transformational action is not an option. The Emissions Gap Report 2019 showed that to have a likely chance1 of meeting the Paris Agreement goals, the cuts in global emissions required per year from 2020 to 2030 are close to 3% for a 2 °C target and more than 7% per year on average for the 1.5 °C goal.

( https://public.wmo.int/en/resources/united_in_science )

More info from the UN Environment Program:

&gt; We are on the brink of missing the opportunity to limit global warming to 1.5°C.

&gt; If we rely only on the current climate commitments of the Paris Agreement, temperatures can be expected to rise to 3.2°C this century. Temperatures have already increased 1.1°C, leaving families, homes and communities devastated.

&gt; We need to close the ‘commitment’ gap between what we say we will do and what we need to do to prevent dangerous levels of climate change. Governments cannot afford to wait. People and families cannot afford to wait. Economies must shift to a decarbonization pathway now. Today our report card says we are failing.

( https://www.unenvironment.org/interactive/emissions-gap-report/2019/ )

People keep claiming that renewable energies are on the rise and their prices in free fall, and yet, no change in emissions is to be seen. Lowering our emissions by 7% per year from now on, or by 15% per year from 2025 is a complete pipe dream and ridiculously unrealistic.

( https://imgur.com/ZG3uLNS )

And that is just one of the two majors issue I'm concerned about. The problem of a changing climate goes hand in hand with the holocene extinction event currently taking place with a potentional collapse of biodiversity and the foodchain as a result. The UN's IPBES estimates that ""roughly one million species of plants and animals face extinction within decades as the result of human actions"".

On the internet, so many people praise a change of diet as one of the few meaningful things an individual can do to help our world. And it is true that food production accounts for about 25-30% of all global greenhouse gas emissions

( https://ourworldindata.org/food-ghg-emissions ).

Anybody paying even a slight amount of attention will understand how ridiculous the idea of many people going vegan really is. Just look at the COVID infection rates in the US and the people protesting against wearing a mask. People can't even accept a fast acting danger such as a virus. Even moreso, humans are terrible at estimating the impacts of slow moving dangers like climate change. Global warming is not going to JUMP at us and suddenly kill a lot of people, like COVID did. The chances of us actually changing our diets on a global scale are near zero.

There are also people like me for whom it is almost impossible to switch to a plant based diet. I suffer from multiple food allergies and food intolerances, which means I suffer from gastro intestinal issues when I eat vegetarian or vegan. This has led me to hate myself a little bit every time I consume a product. Every time I eat something I think about how much CO2 has been emitted for that, how I contribute to the damage, how I feel guilty. I know that, for example, beef and lamb are the most dirty meat and so I avoid them. I have limited all my meat consumption to poultry only, due to the lower CO2e production associated with it. And yet, it is not enough. ( https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local )

Adding to that, if I want to improve my mental condition I need to improve my physical condition as well by exercising more. Since I have been underweight my entire life I need to eat more but this goes hand in hand with an increase in both protein and calorie consumption. The internet has made me feel like a traitor to the human race simply for considering this. How would it be acceptable for me to be so selfish? People are going to die and suffer if we continue to consume like this and I consider increasing it even further?

Simply living in a first world country means I have a crazy CO2 impact on the world. Most people, me included, simply don't have the option of taking public transport to work because the infrastructure just isn't there. I have no choice but to take the car, which I plan on replacing with an EV as soon as financially possible. And even though I will be charging it with the 10 kWp photovoltaic setup on my roof, which not only offsets my entire electric consumption but also that of another 1-2 households, I still produce crazy amounts of CO2 simply by existing.

We need global and systemic change and yet, the current political agendas seem to be mere lip service because even considering things like a high carbon tax and investment into ecological restoration are political suicide. Why would any politician do that? Voters don't seem to care because it MAY affect them negatively NOW ignoring the dangers of climate change which will happen in like a 100 years, right? I'll be dead by then. And politicians are paid by the polluting corporations to not care.

All of the IPCC concentration pathways towards 1.5°C or 2.0°C include carbon capture and storage solution which don't even exist right now and we're not even talking about economical viability. Even more reason why this is not happening.

I beg you, show me where I am wrong. I am looking to be disproven and want hope for the future. Because right now I don't have any left and I'm stuck, paralyzed, with no motivation or reason to continue.

The people around me are living like normal, acting like nothing is happening or merely acknowledging climate change as something that may be happening and may be bad. And then they eat their imported beef steak and fly to their holidays like they deserve it and nothing bad will come from it.

I feel like I'm literally going crazy over this. What the fuck is going on?",climatechange,1601835195

Many of you want to see world peace and less chaos, but the only way to make your dream come true is you must listen to me the world savior, if not then that would never happen unless you are immortal beings who have little interested in mortal human life.  
 

**There are many type of war conflicts going on Earth in 2020, but mostly only 4 types:**  
 **Tier 1:** Religious War.  
 **Tier 2:** Countries Nations War.  
 **Tier 3:** Ideology groups about how to run the social life system such as Capitalism vs Socialism, Climate Change Global Warming, Vegan vs Non-Vegan, Black people vs White people, this that, etc.  
 **Tier 4:** Between people about what is correct or wrong, good or bad, etc. about certain events like a sport match, a scandal, a movie, etc.  
 

For me the World Savior, all of them are very easily to resolved.  
 And the corona virus NCOV COVID is a golden opportunity to end the religious war, and tell people the true purpose of religions was for studying, education.  
 All what you need to do is 1 national government contact me to receive the perfect formula cure which is a set of many religions teaching will make body better off.  
 

\- **Do the Kosher Food in Judaism good for general people, and better than the rest?**  
 Yes, it does.  
 \- **Do eating like Ramadan event in Islam good for human body?**  
 Yes,it does.  
 \- **Do cutting all hair like a monk in Buddhism increase your intelligent and overall health?**  
 Yes, it does.  
 

Just a few examples. The version will be announced to the public if have opportunity will be much better.  
 

If you can resolve the most difficult one the religious war, thus unify all religions, then all kind of national war, groups war are easily to be resolved !!!  
 

Many of you may have different ideologies about many other subjects, but if you want to do anything, you must first unify the people through religions. And the best way now is get behind me The Legendary Savior, you have nothing to lose, all I need is just one announcement from 1 national government !  
 

Remember the deadline is **15-09-2020 September 15th** **2020**, I only listen and answer question at forum **freejoy.aimoo.com**.  
 After that timeline, even the angel/gods/deities come, I will still not going to help any nation unless a super volcano erupt, or any other kind of natural mega disaster occur.

46,How To Make Religions Better Easier For People To Study To Understand By The Savior,"**How To Make Religions Better Easier For People To Study To Understand By The Savior**  
 

The religions was came in the past to teach people, to give people better direction in life, to give them hope about better future, better world.  
 

Nowadays the humanity is in the darkness again where people are instead of learning, studying, build up their knowledge to grow like God, they are chasing for illusion not important stuffs such as money, wealth, title, technology.  
 

It is the time to relive all religions, to unlock it full potential, because it is the best way to teach people about life, to help people get out of stupid conflict in life.  
 

All kind of war caused direct or indirect via religions because of humans simple do not understand the true meaning of those sacred teaching from the highest stand point.  
 

Some beings, groups, entities were trying to make religion conflict just want to people the do more research, to study more about religion, but mortal humans have limited memory storage.  
 

The complex complicated of each religion is beyond even their followers to fully understand it, let’s alone the outsiders.  
 

There are a lot of hidden teaching in many religions not yet brought to light.  
 **Examples:**  
 \- Why those monks in Buddhism need to shave all hair.  
 \- What is the human sin in Christianity, Jewish.  
 \- Why there is a Ramadan event every year in Islam.  
 etc.  
 

The religions have 2 part series, part 1 is blind follow and part 2 is critical thinking, deep learning and understand why do this action,why practice that activity.  
 

If you want to make it better,easier for the people to study, to understand, you must treat it like a big project. But instead of using money to make money, you are using money to make people to study religion more, to have a better life.  
 

**Here is an example how it should be done:**  
 **Step 1:** setup, form 2 or more version of your religion with different target people.  
 such as:Original vs Foreign, Old vs New, Short vs Long, Complicated vs Simplify, No explain vs Explanation, etc.  
 

**Step 2:** using various strategies to attach people to study to learn to understand your religion.  
 like: spend money to make competitions, challenge contest, to crazy thing like religion degree, etc.  
 

Here is to learn of why do this do that practice, not to worship pray or follow.  
 

The rich Arab Royal Families in the Middle East should spend money to explain others about the true pure Islam, they should not spend money for the useless football club.  
 The same go to the Jews, other royals, rich families.  
 

Above is a quick framework of how to make all religions better than ever for the people to easier learn, to study.  
 I am not get paid to do the detail job, so do not expect me to spend time and energy to help your religion for free, you guys must do by your own.  
 

If any beings, groups, entities want to have any discussion about the religions and other life matter, the only place I will answer is at forum **freejoy.aimoo.com**, but with very limited time to **September 15th** **2020**. After that date, I am off the internet and see the natural catastrophe to come !

If you really want the world have peace the you must know what is the correct divine condition to fight for, so you can easily overcome any kind of evil entities,deities.  
 

Many secret societies, organizations are wasting their time, fighting without the correct objective goal. That is why you have the world is chaos mode in 2020 where many national leaders have moral level below animal beings !  
 I am not going to describe it anymore for the real life fake virus pandemic event speak for itself.  
 If it was for education people then it must come with different direction already.  
 

**What is the divine condition for world peace?**  
 The correct one must be true not just in the year 2020 only, but in any timeline throughout history as well.  
 And that one is “piece” nations !  
 Peace and Piece, it is quite similar, and that is the way to go.  
 

Now, why don’t you craft theory about smaller piece nations when a world instead of have only around 200 nations but instead we have 1000 nations.  
 

The reason we had physical weapon wars in history and economic/information war in modern era 2000s is because the people who in charge of many big nations have too much power and have too little enemies. That’s why the ego and the human DNA come into effect.  
 

So if the west, or the east or any kind of entities/societies really want world peace, they must change many objectives such as “human rights”, “economy” to “smaller piece nations”.  
 

**Many of you may ask what is a size of a piece nation?**  
 The answer is that 1 language 1 nation but must come with free will volunteer not by force, that is the way to go and not to go.  
 

The USA can start with rebrand their nation as a Union like the European Union, where each states will become smaller nations with more rights. The same go to the China, Russia, India as well.  
 

I am not going to debate with any of you for above is the perfect Divine Condition for real truly world peace.

51,"The good, green jobs","  

*Environmentalists and unionists are coming together to realise that fighting climate change and upholding labour rights are deeply intertwined.* 

When a solar company in New York laid off its construction workers who were trying to unionise, it was the strong climate movement that came to their rescue. After making national news, the entire staff were rehired. It is, after all, a state where union-led coalitions have achieved some truly progressive and ambitious climate policies. 

It is being made increasingly clear that strong labour protections are necessary for a just energy transition that is far-reaching and effective to ensure we make the best use of the time we have. We can’t protect the planet without also protecting workers and this is especially true of the post-COVID era. It is also conversely true that stable and dignified labour is not possible in a world that is rife is climate-change-related upheavals. 

A plan is necessary to ensure that jobs in renewable energy and energy efficiency are ones that adhere to labour standards, safety and health protections, community benefit agreements, local hire, improved training and working conditions, etc. This unified vision for green jobs would make it easier to direct policymaking for the green transition. 

The upcoming transition to a low-carbon economy will have a big effect on workers. A healthy environment and ethical jobs need not be mutually exclusive. Workers should not be asked to choose between jobs and the environment. Even conservative voters today can’t deny the effects of climate change but don’t want the solutions to cost them their jobs as their day-to-day economic conditions are their primary concern. Which is why unions and employers can find common ground in finding solutions for environmental issues at work, by identifying future adaption and mitigation technologies and instilling sustainable behaviour. 

Over recent decades, the government has relinquished its role in providing opportunity and public goods. The challenge of fighting climate change shouldn’t be allowed to exacerbate this as, goods jobs, fair trade, gender and racial quality, might all be hit if not careful. Both governments and employers are beholden to train their workers for the new green economy - redeploy and upskill them as necessary. 

The government should also see itself as not only a provider of capital infrastructure but also social support through community and child care centres, schools etc that will create an environment where people can care for and support each other through the climate crisis.

 I quoted directly from the research adding nothing else. I did however remove in text citation from the original research as it took up large amounts of space and would have required even more citation. I would encourage you to read the full research articles yourself as these are simply small excerpts that don't do the articles justice.

&amp;#x200B;

*""Firstly, the degree of political polarization that has developed around climate change (in some Western countries, at least) reflects the fact that disagreements about climate change are more likely to be about values than about the underlying science—even though the science is often used as a proxy for these value-based disputes. Although values are fairly abstract concepts, one way in which they are instantiated is through formal political ideologies, which are likely to be more or less favorable to particular climate policies.""*

""*Even casual observers of denialist activities likely notice an obvious pattern; with rare exceptions (e.g., Sallie Baliunas), the most prominent denialists are conservative white males. This is true for contrarian scientists (e.g., Patrick Michaels and Fred Singer), media pundits (e.g., Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck), think tank representatives (e.g., Joseph Bast and William O’Keefe), and politicians (e.g., Senator James Inhofe and Representative Joe Barton). Within the ranks of elites, climate change denialists are overwhelmingly conservative white males. Does a similar pattern exist in the American public?*

*A burgeoning body of literature on the social bases of climate change concern in the American public has emerged in recent years. Such studies have analyzed the direct effects of political ideology, race, and gender, typically finding that self-identified liberals, non-whites and females are more likely to express concern about global warming than are their conservative, white, and male counterparts, respectively. The analysis presented below is the first to (a) consider the intersection of political ideology, race, and gender and (b) explicitly examine climate change denial.*

*...On one level, conservative white males in the general public likely perceive conservative white male elites to be their in-group. Over the last twenty years, conservative white male elites have challenged the reality of climate change via conservative talk radio, websites, television news, and newspapers (e.g., Wolcott, 2007). Thus, we argued that conservative white males in the general public would be more likely than other adults to embrace and defend the claims of conservative white male elites....*

*...On another level, the work of Jost et al. shows that conservatives—and we would extend this to conservative white males—strongly display tendencies to justify and defend the current social and economic system. Conservatives dislike change and uncertainty and attempt to simplify complexity...""*

""*It is often noted that individuals promoting climate change denial, including the small number of contrarian scientists, mainly criticize or “audit” the work of climate scientists (especially as summarized by the IPCC), and only infrequently contribute to climate science themselves. Unlike mainstream climate scientists, who publish primarily in peer-reviewed journals, these critics typically employ a range of non-peer-reviewed outlets, ranging from blogs to the books we are examining. A large majority—97 of the 108 books—are self-published (33), published by a conservative think tank press (35), published by a conservative (or conservative religious) press (17), or published by a popular press (12), and are thus unlikely to have undergone peer review—particularly by individuals with expertise in climate science...*

*...Notably, not a single denial book is published by a university press.*

*The general lack of peer review allows authors or editors of denial books to make inaccurate assertions that misrepresent the current state of climate science. Like the vast range of other non-peer-reviewed material produced by the denial community, book authors can make whatever claims they wish, no matter how scientifically unfounded. In fact, the lack of peer review in the “denialosphere” means that denial claims are continually recycled, no matter how many times they are refuted by empirical test or shown to be logically untenable terms them “zombie arguments” because they repeatedly rise from the grave....*

*Strikingly, many of these books not only provide fallacious critiques of climate science but also present an alternate reality in which global warming is a hoax created by a conspiracy of supposedly greedy scientists, liberal politicians, and environmentalists.*

*Although mainstream scientists occasionally take the time to debunk some of the more visible denial volumes, the proliferation of such books makes it impossible for busy scientists to critically review most of them. Thus, denial books are likely to continue to multiply, and many will receive considerable attention from sympathetic and scientifically unsophisticated audiences.""*",climatechange,1596274332

55,How does this work?,"I’m pretty ignorant when it comes to climate change. I’d greatly appreciate an explanation of how rising global temperatures will spell the end of civilisation as we know it. 

At present, my understanding is that the order of events is something like this:

1. Global (air and sea) temperatures rise

2. Polar and glacial ice melt, raising the global sea level

3. Rising sea levels wreak economic havoc by:
a.  Causing mass migration from low-lying population centres
b. Necessitating the construction of costly sea barriers around wealthier coastal cities

4. Rising sea temperature causes disruption of long-standing oceanic currents, leading to dramatic localised climate change. This is a problem because affected countries must alter their economies and economic output to reflect their new climate reality. This itself is a problem because the change in climate will occur faster than economies can keep up. 

5. Mass famine and starvation will result from the reduction in arable land brought about by rising temps. 

6. If newly suitable countries do not pick up the slack in terms of crop production, global food supply chains will dwindle. This will result in more starvation, and possibly war.

7. Sufficiently fast temperature changes (such as what we are now experiencing) will lead to the destabilisation of local and global ecosystems, and great reduction in biodiversity. This is a bad thing because we rely on these ecosystems for food. If they collapse, global food supply reduces to a point where the present global population cannot be supported.

8. Corollary of (6) and (7): Global temp increases will not lead to the creation of enough new arable land to grow enough crops to support global civilisation in its current form. In other words, arable land lost will not be equal to arable land gained.

1. The theory of the greenhouse effect is wrong.

3. You are wrong.

Points 1 and 2 would be extraordinary discoveries. More than 100 years of experience and science would need to be wrong. Most likely this discovery would be worthy of a Nobel Price. Probably several. And many other accolades. But, naturally, extraordinary evidence is needed to demonstrate that  the science actually is wrong. 

Point 3 seems more likely. Misunderstandings and ignorance. Perhaps intentional disinformation? If 3 is correct it can be expected that the idea has not been published in any scientific paper, simply because it is wrong. It would be more likely to be spread by denier blogs and on the YouTube. And circulate among denier groups that ignore any indication that it is wrong. 

It would be WONDERFUL if the greenhouse theory is wrong. It would be a huge relief. 

Why on earth would you want to keep this secret and under wraps? Is it because it is an obvious lie? And why on earth do you need me to confirm or deny that warm air rises before providing support for your extraordinary claim?

Here is why we our planet is doomed: 

Imagine a group of junior high school students is touring Columbia University and that group happens upon Dr. Broecker or Dr. Hansen. One such prepubescent has the temerity to ask one, or both of these titans if they had considered the possibility that one or more of their conclusions on seminal work could be wrong due to some factor or another. 

Being the Grandfather of Climate Science, I believe Dr. Broecker would admire the young upstart's pluck and even appreciate this student's level of interest... at first. 

Now imagine Dr. Broecker being forced to contend with this child daily. Forced to share an office with them, debate them, and all the while the one child turns to two, then to four, and so on. Increasingly, he must not only share his raw data but also answer infuriating questions like ""What’s this symbol mean?"" 

Eventually any adult let alone a brilliant scientist is going to treat this child like any other child and tell them a bed-time story. Which of us parents have not bargained on a Friday night that, should the little crumb-cruncher go straight to bed this instant, she could skip school tomorrow in favor of ice cream and play? Yes, a clever trick that works great for a while. It is a fact that the child must sleep for their health and well being. They cannot conceive of REM, growth hormones, Circadian rhythms, the water used to weave of the cotton in their blanket that somehow isn't wet now or the filthy coal burning hundreds of miles away making it harder for her to breath and pushing a fatal amperage of alternating current in the pleasant nightlight by her bed. These and a limitless universe of other items we need not explain to them. Of course, we could say to our children,"" You don't have school tomorrow because it is Saturday so be happy about that and go to bed."" The full stick of truth prods with a less pointed end, does it not? No, the false premise serves everyone's sanity much better. 

And here is why we are doomed: This little allegory dissolves out of parallel when you name the insidious little brat the American Public and you realize that the American Public has ALL the grown-up’s money. Just like the harmless trick worked to get them to behave before it will not work now. It doesn't matter that we were right; we lied. It is a fact that the American Public must listen or perish but we took a short cut and with push back are reminded the sharpest stick of motivation is often pointed on both ends. Oh, we could try force and we are trying force, Paris Accord, the courts, EPA, et. al. Deniers won't understand that while you may hold a child down for her shots, (let's pretend they give their children vaccines) you may not hold her down for her health. I imagine that in denier ""parenting"" they have probably tried it but realized quickly no one would receive rest or trust. 

All of our top climate scientist need to walk out front and center, deliver the full truth and reconcile with their lies so that the American Public will trust us again. We treated them like children, they complied for a while, they learned that it wasn't true, at least not for the exact reasons we told them. We cried wolf so many times and now that we need them to help save us all they laugh at us. Now we are now trying force them. It’s not going to work because it isn't the American public that needs to wake up before it is too late. It is us. WE need to rid ourselves of all of the cheap tricks and those that played them. Show the American Public that we know that this was wrong and then they will believe what we say now. They are ready for the science, they are awake and paying attention. We need their help to let our planet rest and recover. We will not get it on the current path. 

This will never happen unless we throw out the old guard. The older scientists know that they were right in their conclusions and don't care about our lives, they won't live another 20 years anyway. Just as a parent does not step down because they tricked their child to sleep for their health, why should climate scientists step down of their own accord just because they delivered a lie that was based on the FACT that we have to let our planet heal? 

We need to do it for them and not just those mentioned here by name, they should not be a convenient scapegoat for the entire industry of climate fright that has cost us so much credibility. Cast them all out. Do not attend their lectures, take classes that include their textbooks, boycott the entire old guard of climate science NOW before it is too late.",climatechange,1592451297
59,What is the Greenhouse Effect theory based on?,"I have debating with someone about the validity of the Greenhouse Effect. They claim it's not true due to CO2 not heating planets up, citing Mars as an example.

However, I've been trying to tell them that the Greenhouse Effect theory is based on atmospheric density: The reason why Venus, for example, is literally Hell. It's not about the gas itself, it's about its amount and the effect it has on density.

But in response, they claim that the Greenhouse theory is actually not based on density at all.

Therefore to settle this we've agreed to ask the subreddit this.

Is the Greenhouse Effect Theory based on atmospheric density caused by emitted gases, or something else?

62,Movie review and commentary Planet of the Humans,"I published this on Medium [Here](https://medium.com/@ryan44934/planet-of-the-humans-a-documentary-without-hope-399c855913a)

 

A poorly edited documentary about the woes of the green revolution was released for free on Youtube yesterday. You might consider its makers the left of the left, a fringe hating the movement generally loved by the left. Can’t anyone who loves the planet get behind green energy? It appears not. I dislike this documentary about as much as I loved it. It highlights some of what I have been thinking for about three years now. What it did not do was offer solutions, which I will do for you and for the makers of this film. If you were to watch this piece and do nothing further you might feel that we are now completely hopeless. The tech we hoped to save us can’t. Wind turbines, solar panels even hydro all have environmental implications. The truth is, the green energy you might be thinking is going to be ubiquitous will just be a small bit player in a truly verdant future.

I’m going to outline for you problems and, in my view, a few viable solutions. First let’s discuss the film itself. The film is bleak starting with an Earth day celebration narrated by a bore in Gibbs. He found diesel backup at an Earth day celebration. Guess what? Who cares. Small beans. The film then goes on to complain about car manufacturers making electric cars, using the Chevy Volt as a prop because the electricity that fuels them in Lansing Michigan is from coal. My question for the film maker is this: Does he expect everything to change all at once in every city in the world? He probably does, but that isn't possible. I think its OK to build a carrot to force the stick be built. It how things are going to happen, if they happen at all. He should be spending his time talking about what it would take for the nation to electrify vehicular travel, with low or no emissions. It still requires the electric car! Damn him for pooing on real progress that was the Volt. If there is a tragedy in the film it’s that Americans didn’t embrace the Volt in the first place!

I’m going to skip to the ending for a minute. Gibbs tell us at the end of the film what we have to do. Its answer: Use less. What an over simplified, ridiculous and vague cop out of an answer. It IS true that we need to use less, but what does he mean by this? How much less? What’s most important to use less of? How should we power the planet for what we still make in an era of less? Should we just turn off the lights and cars and hospitals and businesses and food production and call it a good run for humanity but it’s time to die now? No answers or hints of answers in this film. This is a problematic ending. It decries use of typical energy sources, then does the same to green energy then offers nothing in its place. The film is not *wrong* but it brings us to place of hopelessness where all things are equally bad.

Things are not equally bad. Solar and wind turbines have merit, and it is more than that of coal. Wind turbines for example pay back their manufacturing cost (in terms of greenness not money) in three years. They last for 20. It’s 17 years of useful green energy. It is however intermittent, and when it isnt provide power natural gas is its backup. Windmill farms do, as the documentary spends a lot of time pointing out, often hurt the environment they are put in by having forests cleard for them or killing apex birds. But again, this film fails to offer an answer. Gibbs could have suggested a changes to the EPA that rates environmental degradation prior to placing wind or solar on the land. It is yet again political will that we need here to provide a holistic framework to place renewables. **We should concurrently be working on truly recyclable plastics for everything, including windmills and solar panels.** We should be working more on long term storage batteries including iron flow, and testing out massive gravity storage application to balance out wind and solar. We should be working on replacements for chemicals used in turbines that are extremely environmentally unfriendly like Sulphur hexafluoride, or SF6, which has a CO2 equivalent of 117 tonnes of carbon ([That is not a misprint](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-49567197)) per windmill if emitted. Still these technologies are better than a coal plants which release about two billion tons of CO2 per year. **Remember energy isn't free and steps into the future will involve compromise.**

Next, the problems of accountability shown in the film.

‘Green’ energy is nuanced and we don’t have a standardized system of accounting for what is and isn’t worthwhile. What this documentary revealed was just how far corporate tentacles have reached into the organisations we think untouchable. Examples provided are the Sierra Club, Al Gore and Tesla. However these people and organisations who have put environmentalism on the dinner table menu never get a chance to defend themselves. This film is part hit piece and the director isn’t happy with anyone, including himself.

What Gibbs seems to find most frustrating apart from humanity’s existence is biomass energy. Biomass is difficult to define because it can mean many things. The US energy administration defines biomass as energy derived from burnt wood chips, agriculture waste, food garbage or manure including sewage. This invites an important distinction under the green umbrella. There is renewable and there is low carbon. Burning wood for energy is nice by a campfire but one of the worst ways possible to power an industrialized nation. High resource use, high carbon emission, low energy density, particulate emissions, but yes renewable.

Moving onto solutions Because this movie doesn’t have any. (Warning US centric)

Solution 1) Electrifying everything, especially cars. I am a believer in the series hybrids such as the Volt and this is why I was so upset to see it used as a foil. You can use a lot less cobalt in a battery that is ⅙ the size of a typical Tesla. The Volt had a 50 mile battery and when depleted and gas generator kicked on to power the battery. Most people drive less that 30 miles per day, and would decrease gas use by 70–80% for most people. This is like getting a gasoline car that got 115+ miles per gallon. The Volt could have been the perfect transition vehicle into a more electrified nation. We build chargers everywhere and learn to build better batteries with less rare metals which are toxic, and mined under horrific conditions.

Solution 2) Have a commission that provides both a general rating and a specific rating to a given technology and what can be done to improve it. These ratings should be simple enough for the public to understand them. For example a rating of 1 is the ideal green energy and coal is a 10 where does X technology fall? And on the site that is being proposed, does it change this number. Is this old, slow growth forest move a 3 technology to a 6? Keep the rating measure simple even if what going into the rating is complex. This would help keep things like biomass from seeming friendly when it isn’t.

Solution 3) Solar, wind and hydro where it makes sense while we continue to work on underlying tech that would alleviate the need for natural gas as backup. I feel that solar and wind belongs in rural places that are too small to economically connect to larger electrical grids. So what do I think should power most other things, see solution 4.

Solution 4) Nuclear. The film touches on nuclear for such a short time (about 10 seconds) that you get the feeling that the word nuclear alone is supposed to be enough to scare off any one willing to watch such a film as ‘Planet of the Humans’. What I am calling for is Gen 4 walk away safe Nuclear. Such as what Bill gates has spent a billion of his own dollars [developing.](https://www.terrapower.com/) In addition developing small modular nuclear reactors in the realm of 200–300MWe per unit. Why?

Nuclear is the greenest power source, even compared to wind and solar, [LINK](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nuclear-less-co2-than-solar-hydro-biomass/). It is the least deadly power source [LINK](https://www.statista.com/statistics/494425/death-rate-worldwide-by-energy-source/). It is dispatchable (non variable), meaning it doesn’t require an entire extra natural gas backup plant to exist when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing. Did you know that natural gas companies LOVE wind, are backing and promoting solar and wind energy? For every solar setup we build we are committing ourselves to 20–30 years of a wind/NG combination. It is much better than a coal plant, but much worse than a nuclear plant.

Further, we don’t have to overbuild nuclear energy. To have wind and solar power the US without NG we would have to massively over build capacity (not within any economic reason) [LINK](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/radical-idea-get-high-renewable-electric-grid-build-way-more-solar-and-wind-needed). Nuclear is nearly plug and play and doesn’t require the massive infrastructure overhaul that 100% solar and wind would require.

Downsides of nuclear before the commentators get to it, and no neither the pro or con list is exhaustive.

Cost: Nuclear is very expensive up front. There are plenty of ways to mitigate this but in the end there will always be truth to it. When energy experts consider any form of energy they use LCOE (levelized cost of energy). Nuclear is very competitive in terms of $/kwh, but it requires large upfront investment. What we need is the *ideal* large and small reactors developed with the help of multiple governments and companies. One design for a large plant and one design for a small plant. Then those governments that developed can build it out for free. Ideal designs would be walk away safe design (no meltdown possible), molten salt reactors (efficient, non pressurized reactors), using uranium waste as fuel. That’s right, these plants can eat spent nuclear waste (an over simplification read more about that and more [here](https://www.wired.com/story/next-gen-nuclear/)). Side note: Forget thorium (which has a huge fanboy club), it’s not needed and ultimately has similar problems to uranium. You can still make weapons from it, you can make salt reactors with uranium, and yes I want to use waste uranium — not dig up new thorium.

Nuclear proliferation: Simply put, the biggest contributors to global warming already have nuclear weapons. If in the future these plants made it to countries without nuclear weapons I believe they should be heavily defended but that’s a concern for the distant problem that I wish we had now.

Nuclear waste: The plants I’m espousing use nuclear waste to fuel themselves. Also, consider this. All nuclear waste in the USA right now could fit into one super Walmart. Bam! It is so much more manageable than detractors want you to think and comes down to the one thing I’ve kept mentioning in this article: Political willpower.

One day nuclear power won’t be the best option. We may finally develop a perfect batteries for short, medium and long term energy storage solutions. Fusion might finally work. Maybe clean coal becomes more than a figment of republicans’ imagination (ha!). But for now it is by far the best option we have. We can begin building out our best iterations and keep developing the ideal solution which could be ready for massive implementation in 10 years such as a Terrapower module. It has already been 10 years since the Great recession, what the hell have we been waiting for, a pandemic?

For us to tackle global warming, in time or at all, it is going to take brutal pragmatism. That is why I believe this film, Planet of the Humans, is helpful. While it is unnecessarily hopeless it does convey that not all things are what we think they are. Green isn’t always green, it’s complicated. Right now while trillions of dollars are being spent to support the world during a pandemic is the perfect time to pivot to a long overdue clean future. It might be the only time until another catastrophic event arrives, approximately 10 years from now, making it 40 years later than we should have acted in the first place to save the Earth.",climatechange,1587592969
63,"Why should I worry about global warming? Won't we just adapt, even if the worst DOES in fact happen?","**I made a thread about this but there was not real engagement with my question. I was wondering about detailed scientific information and careful argumentation that could answer the two questions in the title. For some reason, the thread just fizzled out.**

Below is a conversation that I had with some scientists. 

I said:

&gt;There is a cavalier attitude that I've seen of, ""We'll adapt. I'm not worried, if it even happens.""

&gt;How can it be made clear to people that these disruptions will not be so easily adapted to?

One scientist responded: 

&gt;If they don’t want to hear it, there isn’t any changing their mind.

&gt;Only people willing to change their mind in light of evidence are reachable. And for them, they just need be shown the evidence. In that case the strategy from persuasion theory is: keep it simple, easy to understand and short, but well sourced and with an explicit option of where and how to explore each point further should they want to. Any other approach creates tl;dr syndrome and doesn’t get through.

The other responded: 

&gt;The data show that most folks in the US and the world are at least partly on-board on the advantages of reducing global warming.  Those who are not have been exposed, repeatedly, to the major arguments.  Data show that those people primarily consume ""conservative"" media.  The arguments on national security, economy and employment may not work, but are statistically more likely to be important to such folks.  Because efficient responses on energy and environment help economy, employment, and security as well as health, environment and ethics, you can start where people are...

And another response: 

&gt;That's a good point to add: psychology proves motivation is more influential than facts. If people want a thing to be true, they will believe it's true. Which drives all denialism too. So bringing up why it matters can trigger desire. Hence, for example, the national security argument will trigger a fear response that will trigger a desire not to be in danger which can motivate finally considering whether the claim is true. Various people will have different motivational triggers. So no single argument will work on everyone. You have to adapt to your audience.

&gt;It can also be useful to take the street epistemology approach and instead of arguing facts go straight to epistemology: ""Why do you believe that?"" Continue asking that question until they start to realize on their own that their answers are starting to get weak. The downside of that method is that it's extremely time consuming and requires the extended personal attention of a single individual. Not effective en mass.",climatechange,1587357183

70,The truth about sea level rise?,"**First up: Please don't reply to this by reciting Wikipedia or random news articles. I really seek to understand the actual physical workings behind sea level rise and how (if) it is connected to overall global temperatures. Links to scientific articles are welcome, primary sources much preferred.**

***This is no attempt at denying climate change, just a genuine search for knowledge/understanding***

One of the big scary scenarios related to climate change is rapid sea level rise and how it threatens to flood coastal areas and islands. While the actual rate of sea level rise is widely debated in the scientific community, there is overall agreement on the simple fact **that** sea levels indeed **do** rise.

If we set the last glacial maximum (ice age) as a starting point, sea levels have risen rapidly following several melt water pulses over the Younger Dryas period. This rise has subsequently slowed down to a rather slow creep for the last \~8000 years.

*I hope so far everyone is happy to agree with me. I'm having trouble finding reliable graphs for sea level rise as most scientific studies are hidden behind a paywall unless you're enrolled at a university...*

From here on, things get a bit confusing. Obviously the initial rise has been due to glaciers melting and pouring into the oceans. Surely, thermal expansion of the water in the oceans might have played a role, but the sea level chart doesn't seem to be too tightly coupled with actual global temperatures.

So... why has the sea level still been rising for the last 8000 years with the temperatures being relatively stable? (for now ignoring the past 100-150 years to avoid any shit storms)

Has the sea level rise in the past 2000 years still been a consequence of ongoing glacial melting as the balance between the new global temperatures and the extend of land ice hasn't reached an equilibrium yet?

If that were the case, why would such a minor (compared to the Younger Dryas) and short-term temperature shift as we have been seeing in the past \~40 years have any immediate impact on sea level rises?

Is it true that - and if so why - the sea level rise has actually slowed down during the warm period of the early 20th century (1930-40)? And following that, does anyone know if there has been an explanation for this yet: [https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/sensing-our-planet/unexpected-ice](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/sensing-our-planet/unexpected-ice) ?

And lastly, what role do isostatic adjustments play in the sea level changes? Are we still experiencing changes to elevation of land masses due to post-glacial isostatic rebound?

How long does it take to actively affect the ozone layer? I doubt if we switched back to these ways, it would be instantanious, but more of a gradual slow process.

78,"Debunking climate skeptics, part 4: The global cooling consensus of the 1970s","Hi again! Time for the next installment, because I'm procrastinating getting actual work done.

This one is relatively short. Climate skeptics have a common line of argument, that climate scientists were predicting global cooling in the 1970s (and around that time). This isn't wrong, some papers argued for this, but this was a minority scientific opinion even in the 1970s:

 [http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/11584/1/2008bams2370%252E1.pdf](http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/11584/1/2008bams2370%252E1.pdf) 

""There was no scientific consensus in the 1970s that the Earth was headed into an imminent ice age. Indeed, the possibility of anthropogenic warming dominated the peer-reviewed literature even then....

When the myth of the 1970s global cooling scare arises in contemporary discussion over climate change, it is most often in the form of citations not to the scientific literature, but to news media coverage...  

Even cursory review of the news media coverage of the issue reveals that, just as there was no consensus at the time among scientists, so was there also no consensus among journalists. For example, these are titles from two New York Times articles: “Scientists ask why world climate is changing; major cooling may be ahead” (Sullivan 1975a) and “Warming trend seen in climate; two articles counter view that cold period is due” (Sullivan 1975b). Equally juxtaposed were The Cooling (Ponte 1976), which was published the year after Hothouse Earth (Wilcox 1975).""

The results were raw at the time the PSAC report was written, but within 2 yr, the first seminal modeling results from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory team were published. Given their simplifying constraints, they found that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide would raise global temperature 2°C (Manabe and Wetherald 1967). Within a decade, the models’sophistication had grown dramatically, enough for Manabe and Wetherald to conclude that high latitudes were likely to see greater warming in a doubled-CO2  world, and that the intensity of the hydrologic cycle could be expected to increase significantly (Manabe and Wetherald 1975). The accumulating evidence of the new carbon dioxide record and the modeling results was enough for Wallace Broecker to ask in 1975, “Are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming?” Broecker’s answer was a resounding “yes” (Broecker 1975).""

79,Climate change Vs Environmentalism,"So, in order to combat climate change, we need to use clean sources of energy. Currently, climate change activists are pushing solar and wind energy. Because both are unreliable(they both rely on the right weather), they require a system to store the energy. And that brings us to our problem.

There are 2 type of storage for electricity: capacitors and batteries. Unlike batteries, capacitors “charge” virtually instantly, but are too large and expensive to be a viable solution. I’m not sure of the environmental impact, but cost of such a system means we will never find out. 

Climate activists seem to have settled on batteries. Batteries are terrible and don’t last too long. Every battery would need to be replaced every 5-10 years. A lot of energy is lost in the charging process. The materials needed to make the batteries are toxic. The environment is destroyed in the procurement, processing, and disposal. As if the solar panels that need to be replaced every 15-25 years doesn’t generate enough toxic waste. 

What’s the point in stopping climate change if we’re just going to destroy the environment process?

From what I understand the only energy source that can provide clean energy and won’t require us to destroy the environment with batteries is Nuclear energy. And no one is going to go for nuclear energy... Chernobyl and Fukushima  are the first thing that comes to anyone’s mind. And nuclear waste processing is a notoriously dirty business if half of what John Oliver said was true. And most of the active facilities in the US are being closed because their in such severe disrepair.

So I've run across the argument before that it's just a coincidence CO2 atmospheric levels started increasing with human carbon emissions. The argument is usually that fossil fuel carbon emissions per year are low relative to natural fluxes, particularly between the atmosphere and ocean. This is true, but this does not imply that humans are not responsible for the CO2 increase. This has been debated in the scientific literature, so I'm mainly going to quote here.

Harde et al. (2017) published a paper arguing the increase in CO2 is mainly natural (only 15% anthropogenic since the industrial revolution):

 [https://edberry.com/SiteDocs/PDF/Climate/HardeHermann17-March6-CarbonCycle-ResidenceTime.pdf](https://edberry.com/SiteDocs/PDF/Climate/HardeHermann17-March6-CarbonCycle-ResidenceTime.pdf) 

This published comment breaks down what this paper got wrong:

  [https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/faculty/zeebe\_files/Publications/KoehlerGPC17.pdf](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/faculty/zeebe_files/Publications/KoehlerGPC17.pdf) 

"" d gas, industrial processes and land use change (Le Quéré et al., 2016). In the case of non-steady state conditions one can ask the question: How long will the perturbation (here: higher atmospheric CO2 concentration) stay? If one adds a certain amount of anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere at time t0, the concentration will increase suddenly and then fall off following a complicated function that depends on the response of the various active carbon reservoirs (surface ocean, intermediate and deep ocean, marine sediments, terrestrial biosphere). The time connected to such a relaxation in atmospheric CO2 concentration is the adjustment (or equilibration) time and the timescale of interest for the problem at hand. The function how CO2 relaxes after such an initial perturbation can be approximated by the sum of a few exponential functions with different characteristic timescales (e.g. Archer et al., 1997; Lord et al., 2016). Simple one-box models suggest adjustment times of about 70 years, but these models ignore many relevant processes and consequently underestimate this timescale (Cawley, 2011). More complex models suggest adjustment (equilibration) times of well over 100 years, and that it depends on total anthropogenic emissions (Archer et al., 2009; Joos et al., 2013; Lord et al., 2016). When anthropogenic CO2 is added continuously one has to run a global carbon cycle model that takes into account the responses by the various reservoirs mentioned above (e.g. Friedlingstein et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2013). 

The timescale determined in Eqs.(7) and (8) in Harde (2017) is actually an approximation of the residence time, i.e. the average length of time for which an individual molecule of CO2 remains in the atmosphere before being taken up by the ocean or terrestrial biosphere. Given the fluxes into, and out of, the atmosphere, we would expect a CO2 molecule to only remain in the atmosphere for a few years, before being replaced by a molecule from one of the other reservoirs. The usual misunderstanding is that this is CO2 leaving the atmosphere, rather than mostly just being exchanged, leaving no change in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Even though the numbers presented in Harde (2017) are reasonable approximations for the residence time, they are largely irrelevant for what the paper later presents. 

Changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration following the initial perturbation depend on the net CO2 flux out of the atmosphere, rather than - as in the case of the residence time - depending only on the flux into the natural sinks. Note that the residence and adjustment times refer to different and distinct aspects of the carbon cycle and have different definitions; a distinction clearly made in the IPCC First Assessment Report (Houghton et al., 1990, §1.2.1) as well as in more recent reports (Stocker et al., 2013, p. 1457). Thus to conflate residence time and adjustment time is a fundamental misunderstanding of the carbon cycle. 

Given this difference between the residence time (years) and adjustment time (centuries to millennia) we would also not expect an enhancement in atmospheric CO2 to be entirely composed of molecules of directly anthropogenic origin, even if the cause for such an enhancement were entirely anthropogenic. Therefore, the claim in Harde (2017) that the anthropogenic contribution makes up only 15% of the increase since the industrial era - even if correct - is not an indication that the increase is not entirely anthropogenic.""

Another way to look at it is as a mass balance problem:

 [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230615762\_Increase\_in\_observed\_net\_carbon\_dioxide\_uptake\_by\_land\_and\_oceans\_during\_the\_past\_50\_years](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230615762_Increase_in_observed_net_carbon_dioxide_uptake_by_land_and_oceans_during_the_past_50_years) 

From 1959-2010, cumulative human carbon emissions are \~350 PgC, but the added atmospheric CO2 is only \~158 PgC. So the argument that CO2 increase is mainly natural has to deal with the fact that human carbon emissions are approximately double the atmospheric increase. This is another flaw in Harde's paper:

""According to Harde (2017), 4.3% of the actual atmospheric CO2 concentration is of anthropogenic origin. With an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 390 ppm used in Harde (2017), reached in ∼2010, this is similar to a proposed anthropogenic CO2 concentration of about 17 ppm or 36 PgC. It would imply that only 7% of the total anthropogenic emissions remained airborne. The airborne fraction of Harde (2017) is therefore a factor of 6.6 smaller than in the inventory that is supported by observational-based studies.""

TL;DR: Arguments that the modern rise in CO2 is natural rely on confusing the residence time of CO2 with the adjustment time, and comparing human carbon emissions with a larger ocean-atmosphere flux which is nearly in balance, while ignoring simple mass balance estimates of carbon emissions vs. atmospheric increase.",climatechange,1575646846

Global Warming

📷

To my Millennial brothers,

My definition of science is the belief in the ignorance of the experts! I have been studying historical climate change and politics for over10 years. No one in there right mind can deny the climate is changing, the Earth has always been changing and has been through multiple ice ages and warming periods.Isn't it interesting the governments of the world and the media not Non government scientists have been telling us for some time the Earth is is in an **unprecedented period** of global warming?? Is this really true?.. , for starters you will never hear about the **Mid Evil Warming period** apx 1000 AD to 1400 from the media or main stream where the Earth temperatures warmed and accelerated at a much faster rate than today and were much warmer and were responsible for massive migration into the North, this is science not conspiracy theory, how do we know? thousands of studies by honest men of science who study things like tree rings, coral reefs etc, or the Earth was in a cooling phase from 1998 to 2013 without question.Have you ever heard about the acid rain scare in the 90's, holes in the ozone late 90's ?? completely debunked,No true science can deny holes in the ozone being caused by Humans. NO NO Nada NO!! It has been proven the solar flares from the sun are completely responsible for these temporary holes yet hidden and Never mentioned by governments or main stream media. Curious???Governments along with the IPCC ( Intergovernmental Panel on climate change) UN and other power hungry entities,have been using severely slopping misleading studies and bulling anyone who dare disagree with them while they cherry pick information they want to feed to us.

Anybody out there ever listened to government FUNDED studies that suggested if the ice bergs melt **water levels will rise** caused flooding, tsunami's etc? Guess what?? If the average person would think this fallacy through and do a little homework you would **see fast this is misleading** , If you had a glass full of water with ice cubes would the water levelchange when the ice cubes melt??? thinking...... NO!! the water level would actually go down, why? ice is much lighter than water, that why it floats, when ice melts water levels do not rise they go down.

Did you know when the governments funds all there Billions of tax payer studies they focus on Human effect on climate change and completely ignore Astro physics, volcanology and have just recently only started included Oceanology in there cherry picking reports... but WHY??? everyone knows we must do everything possible to love and protect of Earth?

There are **Trillions of dollars** to be made in **structuring, taxing and regulating** green Earth, lets do what we can to protect our beautiful planet but to trust the governments of the world who continue to feed us mis information to fix a problem they say is being caused by Humans and **ZERO** true science behind it is like trusting a fox to guard the hen house.

82,What Does it Mean for Whites if Climate Change is Real?,"[Environmentalism and “green politics” are largely white concerns](https://www.amren.com/commentary/2017/04/white-environmentalism-roosevelt-conservation-environment/), even though the Left has largely monopolized these issues. However, the Left’s “green politics,” combined with support for mass immigration and opposition to nuclear power would mean a future of overcrowding, poverty, and the displacement of whites.

Climate change is another area the Left has been allowed to monopolize. Liberals warns of an apocalypse, in which the wicked (white) industrial nations of the north suffer drought, famine, storms, and floods because of their sins against Mother Earth. And what about the south? It, too, will face these man-made disasters, except with the expectation that its people will flee north to safer spaces — our spaces.

This dynamic — in the context of war as much as climate change — has already had a test-run in Western Europe, in the form of the so-called “migrant crisis.” Millions of African and Middle Eastern people, largely adult Muslim males, have been let into Europe. Because of family reunification, each of these “new Europeans” will in time bring in several more “new Europeans.”

While much of our contemporary Western science is increasingly suspect — with political concerns such as anti-racism inhibiting inquiry in the social sciences — it is reasonable to be skeptic of the Left’s primary scientific cause célèbre: climate change. Obviously there are powerful incentives for believing in man-made climate change, just as for believing in the biological equivalence of races and sexes. One can be fired from Google for questioning such things.

However, for argument’s sake, let’s assume the worst-case scenarios of climate change are true. What are we going to do about rising sea levels? How will this affect Americans who live in coastal areas? What will be done to protect Louisiana, Florida, and Texas? What about New York and New Jersey? If climate patterns really are changing, are we preparing for agricultural disruption in some areas and new opportunities in others? Do we have the legal framework to deal with “climate refugees”?

When the Left tackles climate change, it wants to “save the planet” — but apparently for someone else’s babies. The population explosion in the global south combined with climate change and liberal attitudes towards migration are the single greatest external threat to Western civilization — more serious than Islamic terrorism or Hispanic illegal immigration.

It would be short-sighted to dispute the view that we must become greener and less polluting. And yet, most liberals who think this way promote self-destructive ideas such as having fewer children because it’s “bad for the environment,” and welcoming refugees.

The process of true scientific, open, repeatable, and properly peer reviewed work, for me, doesn’t take place.

Earlier this week I sent this to 5000 scientists and all the worldwide media by email with delivery and read receipts. They are reading it. Friday I will send it to all IPCC scientists. On Tuesday I showed their simulations to an expert in simulations and he started uncontrollable laughter.

We are scientists who follow the data. The IPCC (The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) does not perform correct science. I performed expert analyses for the SR 1.5 Chapter 2 mitigation.  It’s all wrong.  I sent it to the media and they will not tell the truth. The attachment their report I reviewed!  

Key findings:

1. Their so called equilibrium statement had no references to any published work.

2. I sent emails to Chapter two authors and Dr. Hauptmann replied. It is not an equilibrium statement it’s from a simulation.

3. I looked at their simulations and they are garbage because they don’t have boundary conditions. Their simulation goes past zero to negative emissions. This is why nothing they have predicted has or will come true.

4. They use the term NetZeroCO2e without definition.

5. They use nonscientific terms like highly likely instead of probability.

6. Their only use of probability shows their solution for lowering CO2 by working on emissions is 50-66%. It’s actually zero because the minimum residence of atmospheric CO2 is hundreds of years. Planting trees is 100% probable to lower CO2.

7. No one and No media should trust the IPCC.

These IPCC scientists know how to perform cause and effect analyses just like I am an expert at. However they don’t perform them because it does not fit their false agenda.   Also we recently wrote the world’s first Atmospheric Carbon dioxide equilibrium paper. The term NetzeroCO2 has never been defined previously. NetZeroCO2e=9.2gt/yr. Natural emissions are 20 gt/yr. This is why anything we do with emissions will never get us to equilibrium. We can easily plant 100 billion native trees in the USA and in 10 years will increase photosynthesis consumption of CO2 by 10 gt/yr. Trees have many advantages. They shade the earth, consume CO2, suck up the sun  and release terpenes which seed clouds and causes extra rain.

85,Co2 controlled climate change is a lie and here's why. Co2 can only absorb -80 at peak.,"""The glaciers are melting"". ""homes are burning"". ""Polar bears are starving"" ""July is the hottest month on record"". ""People are dying!"" ""We're in the beginning of a great extinction""  - Greta.

There's about 1000 different sub categories to debate and argue to no end. But none of that stuff matters. Is there climate change? Perhaps something is going on. Is it unprecedented? Maybe yes, maybe no. There's graphs and charts, historical temperature records and all kinds of hand waving pointing to ""climate change"".  Except, no one talks about CO2.  The climate discussion begins with co2 and ends with subjective arguments over graphs, rain and droughts instead.  

Have any of you actually thought about co2? What questions would you ask to inform yourself enough to make a decision about it? They say co2 is a pollutant and it ""traps"" heat.  Is that true? Can heat be ""trapped"" ? Is co2 really pollutant? The answer is no to both. We can debate that if you like but the questions need to go deeper. What would be the first and only question about co2 that you really need to ask? To end this charade once and for all?  Seeing all roads lead back to Rome, the debate starts and ends with this. How much energy can co2 absorb? 

Most of you here on Reddit are probably young, still in school and getting thoroughly indoctrinated by know-nothing teachers who jump on the climate change bandwagon with little to no thought. What do you imagine when your teachers tell you heat is being trapped by co2 and it's going to continuously warm the planet? They tell you IR heat from the planet can't escape to space. Ok, sure. Did you ever ask ""how much heat"" can't escape to space?  If you did ask, can your teacher answer? Probably not.  Did you ever ask how much co2 is in our atmosphere? The answer is only .04 %. But wait! there's more!

Ask your teacher how much energy co2 absorbs.  Now, are you imagining co2 is absorbing ALL our heat and sending it straight back to earth in the form of  ""back radiation""?  Well, you would be wrong.  Water vapor makes up 95% of all greenhouse gases, but even if that doesn't make you reconsider co2's power, consider this. Co2 only absorbs light (IR) photons which are only 15µm wide. That's 15 microns. What does this mean?  It means 15µm only absorbs the weakest, coldest part of the IR spectrum. How cold? 193 K or  -80 Celsius. That's COLD. Or rather, more specifically, that's heat! Absolute zero Kelvin is the coldest you can get. That's when molecules stop moving. So even 193K is still considered heat. 

Light waves, in the simplest explanation, is like a spring or a slinky toy. The smaller the spring, the more energy it contains. Stretch the spring out, the less energy it contains. X-rays, gamma rays etc, stuff that will kill you, is in the 1-2 µm range or ""short wave"".  However, after it hits the earth, it converts to long wave energy. Most may know this already. However, even an ice-cube emits LWIR because an ice-cube is not absolute zero Kelvin.  It has heat.  But like I said, 15µm is of the weakest part of the IR spectrum which co2 absorbs and you don't have to take my word for it. 

Wien's law is the formula used to derive temperatures of a black body (something that absorbs all light waves). It's how we know the temp of stars, by analyzing the color of light being emitted and applying Wien's law. So what happens when you apply Wien's law to the IR spectrum of 15µm?

 [https://rechneronline.de/spectrum/](https://rechneronline.de/spectrum/) 

Do it yourself. Don't get overwhelmed by the formulas and numbers. Just edit the wavelength field to 15 then select micrometers from the drop down to the right. Hit =.  No need to worry about the other fields, they will populate accordingly.  What's the result? 193.18 K or -80C. 

In conclusion. The atmosphere is warmer than -80C and it is an absolute impossibility for co2 to make it warmer with heat/energy that is -80. That's colder than my freezer and in essence, alarmists want you to believe temps colder than my freezer will overheat our atmosphere and planet.  Bring this up next time your teacher goes on a rant about ""climate change"".  This is the only argument we need to be having.

It makes no sense to look after one’s patrimony only to give it away to outsiders — which means the entire leftist solution to climate change is bogus.

Climate change does not have to end in national suicide. The Right’s response must seek to combat its effects in the interest of our national well-being. Initiatives to slow or reverse climate change are far less crucial than strengthening our capacity to deal with natural disasters in low-lying areas and to capitalize on new opportunities in the warming north. Assistance to other countries is the lowest priority. Resettling millions of their displaced into our countries is not acceptable. Those leaving the global south would soon be replaced by new births anyway. Migration triggered by climate change would overwhelm us.

We should therefore have several goals: mitigate the effects of climate change and strengthen our defenses against them, profit from any benefits of climate change, and reform our thinking on immigration and refugees to prevent a climate-driven demographic catastrophe.

Anyone care to pick some of them apart?," [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viq9dyEHyVF8npfPn8VUEsiGRnul1qmagiWV7cyvprs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viq9dyEHyVF8npfPn8VUEsiGRnul1qmagiWV7cyvprs/edit?usp=sharing)

Here's how science really works: 

Based on observations about a phenomenon of interest, a possible explanation for those observations is formulated. This explanation is sometimes called a Theory. A theory is only someones idea for why an observation is so. It is neither true or false, it is simply a possible explanation. (It is very important to recognize the differences between “observations” and “explanations” or interpretation. A material is liquid is an observation, a liquid substance is water is an explanation.) 

Now, with a theory that possibly explains an observation, attention turns to trying to demonstrate this theory to be true or false. The ways this is done is to make a prediction based on the assumption that the theory is true. With that prediction as a guide, experiments are devised to test the prediction. Based on observations from these experiments one gain information supporting or disproving the theory upon which the prediction was made. Two possible outcomes: 

1. Observations support the correctness of the prediction or 2. They do not support the correctness of the prediction According to the words of Alber Einstein: “No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.” This is to say, #1 cannot prove a theory correct, but # 2 came prove a theory wrong! One of the most important facts about science is that you can never absolutely prove anything with it. All it takes is one case of something not following the scientific idea — whether hypothesis, theory, or law — and that idea is dead. That's how science works. Theories are routinely modified to account for the failures of predictions based on them to be correct. Atomic theory is a good example of this. Since its introduction into scientific thought, it has been changed significantly. Even in our own lifes times this theory as gone through revised. What we learned in our High School science classes is simply not longer considered to be true. As scientists continue to find supporting evidence and refine the theory, it eventually becomes a scientific law. Science is not done by popular vote. Science is not done by consensus. The ultimate truth in science are direct observations of how things happen physically in Nature. Science is knowledge about or study of the natural world based on facts learned through experiments and observation. Politics has no place in this effort and certainly cannot declare a scientific theory as valid or invalid. 

The climate change theory: 

In 1859, John Tyndall documented that greenhouse gases absorb infrared energy radiated by Earth. Since then, it has been assumed that an increase in the concentrations of these gases causes air to warm. This widespread assumption, however, has never been validated by an experiment in the field or in the laboratory. Greenhouse-warming theory was quantified by Svante Arrhenius in 1896, states that average global surface temperatures rise when increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere absorb increasing amounts of infrared radiation from Earth. In other words, the surface of Earth is warmed when Earth’s lower atmosphere absorbs thermal radiation emitted at Earth’s surface. This rise in temperature is estimated to be a few degrees Celsius when the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is doubled. 

Here is some related science: 

1. To make something hotter, you must add heat. (Greenhouse gases simply do not absorb enough heat to have a major effect on global temperatures.) 

2. In Nature, no body of matter is observed to be warmed in any way by absorbing its own radiation. Such warming is not physically possible. If it were possible, bodies of matter could, under the right circumstances, spontaneously heat up—something that does not happen. 

3. When two bodies of matter, both as the same temperature,are positioned next to each other. Each potentially absorbing radiation from the other. Neither can become hotter. no matter how long you wait. Both bodies can lose heat to cooler surroundings, but neither can absorb heat from the other body as long as both bodies are at the same temperature. 

4. There is no such thing as “cold”. Cold is simply the absence of heat. Heat is a form of energy being transferred from a body of higher temperature to a body of lower temperature. 

5. Blankets slow the loss of thermal energy from a body of matter, but a blanket cannot be the source of new thermal energy required to increase the temperature of the body under the blanket, unless it is an electric blanket that adds thermal energy from somewhere else. It is our bodies own thermal energy that warms us when under a blanket. 

6. The stratosphere, which does act like an electric blanket. The stratosphere is the only part of the atmosphere below the thermosphere where temperatures increase with increasing altitude. This temperature increase is caused by high-energy, solar, ultraviolet radiation that dissociates a bond holding together gas molecules such as oxygen, ozone, and carbon dioxide. Upon dissociation, when the bond is broken, the pieces of a gas molecule fly apart at high velocity. Temperature of a gas is well-known to be proportional to the average kinetic energy of motion of all gas molecules, which for a single molecule is equal to its mass times its velocity squared. Thus, when a molecular bond is dissociated, all of the energy holding that molecule together is released to heat the body of the atmosphere. The gases in the lower atmosphere are NOT broken up. 

7. Gases (including greenhouse gases) are observed to absorb infrared radiation into the oscillations of the bonds that hold each gas molecule together. This has no direct effect on the temperature of the gas or gases. 

8. The temperature of a gas is proportional to the average kinetic energy of all the gas molecules, which is proportional to the average velocity of all the gas molecules squared. 

9. Radiant thermal energy is observed to be a function of frequency of oscillation of the bonds holding matter together and is not a function of amplitude or bandwidth of the radiation. 

10.Radiation from a thermal body cannot warm the same body, even if perfectly reflected back. This would be the thermodynamic equivalent of a perpetual motion machine. 

11.Heat flows from hot to cold according to the second law of thermodynamics.Radiation from a colder atmosphere, therefore, cannot warm a warmer Earth. You do not get warm standing next to a cold stove. 

12.The solubility of CO2 in seawater increases as the oceans cool. Observed warming of the oceans could be the primary cause for increasing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere 

13.The fraction of CO2 in the atmosphere is so small (\~400 ppm CO2) making it impossible to change the temperature of the entire body of the atmosphere. (Suppose you have a million dollars, 1,000,000, 400 ppm would be $400 out of the 1 million dollars. I would dare say that if I gave you a $999,600 instead of exactly $1,000,000 you would not much care about the missing $400.) It appears that saying 400 ppm changes the temperature of the 5.1 x 10\^18 kg of the atmosphere is sort of like the tail shaking the dog. 

14.Carbon-dioxide is is very soluble in water so it must be washed out of the atmosphere by rain which impedes an unlimited accumulation. The fact that this leads to an acidification of the rain, and–in the long-term–of the oceans which impairs the plankton, may be a factor to be reckoned with but it has nothing to do with the atmospheric warming. 

15.An increase in one variable (carbon-dioxide concentration) with an increase of a second variable(average global temperature increased), does not prove a causal relationship. 

16.Any artificial greenhouse is a closed system, it needs a solid transparent roof, which is absent in the case of the atmosphere. Energy and mass are not allow to pass into or out of a closed system. In the artificial greenhouse, the solid surface is important and basically constant.The atmosphere, is an open system, which behaves totally different than closed systems. Energy and mass can move freely into and out of an open system. Comparing the two is not meaningful. The surface of the earth is certainly not consist. 

17. The atmosphere cannot be treated as a static object being solely characterised by an average global temperature value, the fact that it behaves dynamically exhibiting diurnal, seasonal and annual fluctuations, and that the structure of the Earth surface is quite variable with respect to the proportion of land and sea surface, apart from the geographical latitude and the existence of mountains inducing different climatic zones. 

18.Our knowledge of the earth, its lands, oceans and atmosphere, is still in its infancy. How is it possible to make predictions about something that we essentially know nothing about. This like add 5 to an unknown number yet arriving at a known number: 5 + ? = 10, can’t do it. 

19.The atmosphere is not a whole uniform object. One only has to travel by air a few times to realize that it has “whole” or “bumps” in it. Why? 

20. Models are approximations of reality. They are the predictions. How accurate are the models predicting global temperature compared to actual temperatures? It should be easy to devise experiments to test this. Send balloons into the upper atmosphere to make actual measurement. Compare those actual measurements to the predictions models would make? Remember, one failure constitutes a proof that the theory upon which the prediction is based is wrong. 

21.What experiments have been carried out to test the currently accepted climate change theory. 

22.Measurements of large bodies such as the whole ocean, the whole atmosphere, or even large objects making these up is extremely difficult and have a high degree of uncertainty. 

23.CO2 (and other gases) consisting of two or more dissimilar atoms absorb infrared (IR) radiation in a characteristic, unique manner. Water vapor, methane, CO2 and CO are all gases that can be measured with IR sensors. Therefore, IR detectors are the most widely used for CO2 analyzers. 

24.""The Keeling curve,” which is widely used to show the increase in CO2 emissions, is based on data from the top of Mount Mauna Loa in Hawaii. Mauna 4 Loa is a volcano. Is a volcano a good place to sample the atmosphere? The most critical step in the analysis process is sampling. 25. ACES ( ASCENDS CarbonHawk Experiment Simulator) From an aircraft at 30,000 feet, ACES pointed five lasers at the surface of the earth below. ( ASCENDS, which stands for Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days and Seasons.) The science community and NASA envisioned ASCENDS as a way to fill gaps in the current knowledge about where atmospheric carbon dioxide comes from and where it goes. This suggests that the scientists do not have great faith in the traditional methods for measuring the concentration of greenhouse gases. The instruments are considered passive instruments. That means they make carbon dioxide measurements by observing the gas’s effect on sunlight. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, carbon dioxide and other molecules absorb light at distinct frequencies. The pattern of absorption can be as unique as a fingerprint. The intensity of the reflected sunlight from the Earth’s surface, which is partially absorbed by carbon dioxide and oxygen is recorded by the satellite and used to calculate how much carbon dioxide there is between the satellite and the surface. Passive measurements have a limitation, they can only operate in daylight. It’s important to know what’s happening at night. ACES is an active system. That is, its own light in the form of a laser. 

26.Current theory on climate changes rely on historical amount of CO2. These are determined by measuring the air trapped in the earth’s glaciers. These measurements make assumptions that are probably not correct. 

27.Weather ain't climate and climate ain’t weather. If this is so, what is the difference? My understanding is that water is a major factor in weather. What is the role of atmospheric water in current climate change theory? 

28.Increasing atmospheric carbon-dioxide slows plant uptake of water, thus this increase should result in increases in soil moisture. Is this happening? 

29.Are the other theories regarding increasing atmospheric temperature? I have found only 7: 

a. The anthropogenic global warming theory b. Bio-thermostat c. Cloud formation and albedo d. Human forcings besides greenhouse gases e. Ocean currents f. Planetary motion g. Solar variability",climatechange,1570718988
92,Greta Thunberg only traveling to sell a book?,"My dad believes that Greta Thunberg is only traveling and talking about Climate change, so people would buy the book her parents wrote.

Is this true? I doubt it is. But when i tried to search it up, i found nothing. Where did he get this from and is it true?",climatechange,1569393348
93,Climate change is important only for 10 months of a year,"The protest against climate change seems to be closely related to human activity and that is called school. 

It became clear to me today, that this climate change protest from students all over the world is only used as an excuse to leave school and I bet they will keep using this excuse. Yes, there might be couple true believers but after watching couple ""interviews"" with the students, they all have prepared lines, it's like a rehearsed cultural performance. 
 
I am a bit sick of this exploitation by the media. Why not organize the protesters to do something actively for the environment, like cleaning the forests or planting trees. I guess it is much harder than standing with a sign and chanting nonsensical slogans.",climatechange,1568979272
94,Curious. Who are the 3% of scientists that don't believe in climate change?,"I can't really find any data on them, or even if they exist for that matter, making the 97% claim entirely false. Even says it on the NASA website, with no real link to who they are. 

I'd like to be able to view their data to see if it's actually legible, as I've heard scientists say science isn't a consensus, but they set up a consensus to shut down any rebuttal in the matter. So being skeptical of the inherent dangers of climate change, is the same as not believing in gravity, evolution, or the spherical nature of our planet. 

My view is that it's a fairly new theory and there's really no broadcasted objection to it, makes me think it's either 100% true or misleading in some way.",climatechange,1567717084
95,anxienty about economic collapse caused by climate change,"With the issues we are facing now, i am really confused about how i am gonna live my life on daily basis to long term. I do read the sticky'd post about paranoia and attitude problems, but i just can't help it but feeling kinda depressed.



 
 
First off, i do agree we won't go extinct or become like mad max or something that drastic, but my concern are alot more smaller in scale and kinda selfish.
 
 
 
I really want clarity towards how should i treat my assets, income and behavior in the wake of our current predicament. I keep reading sources, and articles, books, et cetera. It seems even in the best case scenario, our life in the next several decades will undergo a drastic changes, that will directly affect individuals, and especially the value of money.

i really don't know. i was promised that hard work will bear fruit, there is a saying in my country that means basically this: ""if you work hard, you will enjoy the fruits of your labor later"" assuming there is a future to be had. 

i am in my mid 20's and while it is true, i always feel it is within my capabilities if i work my ass now, i can slowly build my wealth and assets and enjoy a comfy retirement. with the threats climate change pose now, i don't feel it is worth trading my present for a future that is uncertain at best, and non-existent at worst. what do i do with all these money in the future, if say 40 years from now money is basically dirt? why should i just spend my income on frivolous things, only have minimum emergency savings, dont bother to invest long term, etc? 

assuming money is like time, would you invest your money on a shipping company whose ships are full of holes? no. i just feel like ""meh, just enjoy your life, buy whatever you want because it might not last"" and it can be nerve wracking. the expectations of life i was taught as a child is really shattered. i really wonder do i even want to seriously build a family in an uncertain world like this? thinking about our uncertain future? i am confused because no matter how i see it, even in the best case scenario, society will undergo drastic changes and most things we consider valuable will be worthless and i might not be able to enjoy the stuff i have been holding out for 'retirement'  because it might not be possible at all. 


the attitude might be not so bad, but sometimes the pressure of 'normalcy' is crushing. almost all people i know in life acts like there is no problem, and society will go towards the course it have been since WW II, aka optimistic progress and abundance of wealth and stability. i would love to be wrong, but i feel like they are ignorant, and in their ignorant, judge me. they will think i am crazy for thinking the way i am now. it is just frustrating. i am frustrated and really don't know how to act properly. the peak of my frustrations are when i read the article where celebrity climate change advocate are attending summit with their fuel guzzling private jets. while i work hard, while also giving up some life's conveniences to help the planet, this bastards live using more carbon in a day of their lives than i use in a year, and still have the gall to say publicly ""mm okay guys, let's save our planet by working together, save energy blah blah blah"" while they wear $10000 suit that in manufacturing alone cost more than my carbon emission in a year of my daily life. 

i am confused, and at the brink of full on depression and anger.",climatechange,1566908557

99,"Is my idea for a globalised high-speed, intercity and local rail network a good one?","I have had an idea for a global rail network and I wanted to know what you guys thought.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in the UK where people, including me, always moan about poor rail service. But I have always had ideas on how I can make it better. I have redesigned the rail timetable for my hometown (Southport) which included the following services:

&amp;#x200B;

Intercity: Southport, Wigan wallgate, Bolton, Salford crescent, Manchester oxford road, Manchester Piccadilly, Manchester Airport (4 minutes past each hour)

Regional: Southport, Meols cop, Bescar lane, new lane, Burscough bridge, Hoscar, Parbold, Appley bridge, Gathurst, Wigan Wallgate, Ince, Hindley, Daisy hill, Hag fold, Atherton, Walkden, Swinton, Salford crescent, Salford central, Manchester Victoria (14 minutes past each hour)

Intercity: Southport, Wigan Wallgate, Atherton, Salford crescent, Manchester Victoria, Rochdale, Hebden bridge, Halifax, Dewsbury, Leeds. (24 minutes past each hour)

Intercity: Southport, Wigan Wallgate, Bolton, Salford crescent, Manchester oxford road, Manchester Piccadilly, Manchester airport. (34 minutes past each hour)

Regional: Southport, Meols cop, Bescar lane, new lane, Burscough bridge, Hoscar, Parbold, Appley bridge, Gathurst, Wigan wallgate, Ince, Hindley, Daisy hill, Westhoughton, Bolton (44 minutes past each hour)

Intercity: Southport, Wigan Wallgate, Atherton, Salford crescent, Manchester oxford road, Manchester Piccadilly, Manchester airport. (54 Minutes past each hour)

&amp;#x200B;

All trains would run entirely on electric produced by renewable sources and run on the existing lines.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been watching Greta Thunberg's videos a lot and although I despise it when she tells people to panic I think there is a lot of truth in her and I admire her. she has given me a lot of inspiration on how to save the planet. I myself have often been told about global warming and thought ""Wait a minute: if all of this is true then why do people keep driving petrol and diesel cars? Why do the government keep these polluting power stations going? Why are we still chopping down forests?"", I even cried once when my teacher said it was ""A threat to the world"" I am very proud of her for what she has done. I couldn't have done that myself. I didn't have the courage.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, I was looking at a rail map of Sweden, produced by SJ. I thought the interface was great, however the rail service which it represented could have been better. I started recreating the map. I added the smaller stations along the way and created a map key to say whether a train should continue or terminate at each station. I created angles to make it more obvious which line the train was going to go down.

&amp;#x200B;

Then it hit me. The different thicknesses of the lines, the different sized dots representing each station. I was flooded with inspiration. Why bother running a high-speed train between the largest dots if it would only serve 3 stations? Why bother having Intercity trains when there are only 2 stops between each Intercity station? Why should only one sparsely-populated country have an impeccable rail system? I know how bad air travel is for the planet and although I thoroughly enjoy the experience of flying I want people to know that we can't keep doing this. For us to have a truly zero-emissions society we must stop all emissions from aviation and unless they can make all planes in the sky electric by 2025 this can only be achieved by stopping aviation altogether.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to continue creating this map as I thought it could really help the world, but I wanted to know what people thought of my idea. Again all trains will run on renewable energy. In addition the plan will include minimal construction of new lines; a maximum of 5 new high-speed rail lines will be constructed in each country. This will help reduce the railway's impact on the earthy's wildlife. In some cases I could convert certain motorways into high-speed rail lines if you would like. The map will also take into account the existing railways and routes will be changed to reduce changeovers and journey times by better planning. if you don't like my then I won't take offence. If you think my idea could be improved or have any suggestions then please tell me.",climatechange,1565890838
